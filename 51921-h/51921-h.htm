    <h2>
      I&mdash;A ROMANCE
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OT for the honor
      of winning the Vanderbilt Cup, nor for the glory of pitching a major
      league baseball team into the world's championship, would Tony Ball have
      admitted to the familiar and derisive group in the drugstore that he was&mdash;in
      the exact, physical aspect of the word&mdash;pure. Secretly, and in an
      entirely natural and healthy manner, he was ashamed of his innocence. He
      carefully concealed it in an elaborate assumption of wide worldly
      knowledge and experience, in an attitude of cynical comprehension, and
      indifference toward <i>girls</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But he might have spared himself the effort, the fictions, of his pose&mdash;had
      he proclaimed his ignorance aloud from the brilliantly lighted entrance to
      the drugstore no one who knew him in the midweek, night throng on
      Ellerton's main street would have credited Anthony with anything beyond a
      thin and surprising joke. He was, at twenty, the absolute, adventurous
      opposite of any conscious or cloistered virtue: the careless carriage of
      his big, loose frame; his frank, smiling grey eyes and ample mouth; his
      very, drawling voice&mdash;all marked him for a loiterer in the pleasant
      and sunny places of life, indifferent to the rigors of a mental or moral
      discipline.
    </p>
    <p>
      The accumulated facts of his existence fully bore this out: the number of
      schools from which, playing superlative baseball, he had been still
      obliged to leave, carrying with him the cordial good will of master and
      fellow, for an unconquerable, irresponsible laxity; the number and variety
      of occupations that had claimed him in the past three years, every one of
      which at their inception certain, he felt confident, to carry him beyond
      all dreams and necessity of avarice; and every one, in his rapidly
      diminishing interest, attention, or because of persistent, adverse
      conditions over which, he asseverated, he had no control, turning into a
      fallow field, a disastrous venture; and, conclusively, the group of
      familiars, the easy companions of idle hours, to which he had gravitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      He met his mates by appointment at Doctor Allhop's drugstore, or by an
      elaborate system of whistled formulas from the street, at which he would
      rise with a muttered excuse from the dinner table and disappear.&mdash;He
      was rarely if ever sought outright at his father's house; it was quite
      another sort of boy who met and discoursed easily with sisters, who
      unperturbed greeted mothers face to face.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would have been useless, had he known it, to protest his virtue inside
      the drugstore or out; a curious chain of coincidents had preserved it.
      Again and again he had been at the point of surrendering his involuntary
      Eden, and always the accident, the interruption, had befallen, always he
      had retired in a state of more or less orderly celibacy. On the occasion
      of one of those nocturnal, metropolitan escapades by which matured boys,
      in a warm, red veil of whiskey, assert their manhood and independence, he
      had been thrust in a drunken stupor into the baggage car of the &ldquo;owl&rdquo;
       train to Ellerton. Instances might be multiplied: life, in its haphazard
      manner, its uncharted tides and eddies sweeping arbitrarily up and down
      the world, had carelessly preserved in him that concrete ideal which
      myriads of heroic and agonized beings had striven terribly and in vain to
      ward.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it happened, when Doctor Allhop turned with an elaborate
      impropriety from the pills he was compounding in a porcelain pestle, that
      Anthony's laugh was loudest, his gusto most marked, in the group gathered
      at the back of the drugstore. A wooden screen divided them, hid the
      shelves of bottles, the water sink, and the other properties and
      ingredients of the druggist's profession, from the glittering and public
      exhibition of the finished article, the marble slab and silver mouths of
      the sodawater fountain, the uninitiated throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was sitting on a case of prepared food, his legs thrust out before him,
      and a thread of smoke coiling bluely from the cigarette held in his broad,
      scarred hand. There was a little gay song on his lips, and a roving, gay
      glint in his direct gaze. At frequent intervals he surveyed with
      approbation maroon socks and a pair of new and shining pumps; the rest of
      his apparel was negligent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sole chair was occupied by the plump bulk of Thomas Addington
      Meredith, to whom a sharp nose in a moonlike countenance lent an
      expression of constant inquiry and foxy caution. He was elaborately
      apparelled in a suit which boasted a waistcoat draped with the gold chain
      of an authentic timepiece; while, closing a silver cigarette case scrolled
      large with his initials, a fat finger bore a ruby that, rumor circulated,
      had been the gift of a married woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lounging against a shelf Alfred Craik gazed absently at his blackened and
      broken fingernails, his greasy palms. He was Anthony's partner in the
      current industry of a machine shop and garage, maintained in a dilapidated
      stable on the outskirts of Ellerton. It was a concern mainly upheld by a
      daily levy on the Ball family for necessary tools and accessories. He was,
      as always, silent, detached.
    </p>
    <p>
      But William Williams amply atoned for any taciturnity on the part of the
      others; he had returned a short while before from two checkered years in
      the West; and, a broad felt hat cinched with a carved leather hand pushed
      back from his brow, and waving the formidable stump of a cigar, he
      expiated excitedly on the pleasures of that far, liberal land.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he proclaimed, &ldquo;I owe a saloon keeper in San Francisco sixty-five
      dollars for one round of drinks&mdash;the joint was full and it was up to
      me... nothing but champagne went, understand! He knows he'll get it. Why,
      I collared ten dollars a day overseeing sheep. I cleaned up three thousand
      in one little deal; it was in Butte City; it lasted nine days. But
      'Frisco's the place&mdash;all the girls there are good sports, all the men
      spenders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you come back East for?&rdquo; Alfred Craik demanded; &ldquo;why didn't you
      stay right with it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got up against it,&rdquo; William grinned; &ldquo;the old man wouldn't give me
      another stake.&rdquo; The thought of the glories he had been forced to
      relinquish started him afresh. &ldquo;I cleaned up enough in a week at
      billiards,&rdquo; he boasted, &ldquo;to keep me in Ellerton a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't Bert Dingley take four bits from you last night at Hinkle's?&rdquo;
       Anthony lazily asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That farmer!&rdquo; the other scoffed; &ldquo;I had a rank cue; they are all rank at
      Hinkle's. I'll match him in a decent parlor for any amount.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much will you put up?&rdquo; Meredith demanded; &ldquo;I will back Bert.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much have you got?&rdquo; William queried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this was San Francisco I could get a hundred.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you got in real coin, Bill?&rdquo; Tony joined in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three nickles,&rdquo; William Williams admitted moodily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got thirty-five cents,&rdquo; Thomas added. &ldquo;I wish I could get a piece of
      change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's the car?&rdquo; Anthony turned to hiss partner in the lull that followed.
      The &ldquo;car,&rdquo; their sole professional charge, had been placed in their hands
      by an optimistic and benevolent connection of the Balls.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had the differential apart again to-day,&rdquo; Alfred responded, &ldquo;but I
      can't find that grinding anywhere. It will have to be all torn down,&rdquo; he
      announced with sombre enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have had that dam' thing apart three times in the last four weeks,
      and every time you put it together it's worse,&rdquo; Anthony protested; &ldquo;the
      cylinder casing leaks, and God knows what you did to the gears.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I had a piece of change,&rdquo; Thomas Meredith repeated, in a manner
      patently mysterious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A temporary sacrifice of your tin shop&mdash;&rdquo; Doctor Allhop suggested,
      tinning from the skilful moulding of the pills on a glass slab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a chance! the family figurehead announced that he had taken my watch
      'out' for the last time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wants to plaster it on some Highschool skirt,&rdquo; Alfred announced
      unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This robbing the nursery makes me ill,&rdquo; William protested. &ldquo;Out in Denver
      there are real queens with gold hair&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His period was lost in a yapping chorus from the west-wearied circle.
      &ldquo;Take it to bed with you,&rdquo; he was entreated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing in the Highschool can reach these,&rdquo; Meredith assured them, &ldquo;this
      is the real thing&mdash;an all night seance. They have just moved in by
      the slaughter house; a regular pipe&mdash;their father is dead, and the
      old woman's deaf. Two sisters... one has got red hair, and the other can
      kick higher'n you can hold your hand. The night I went I had to leave
      early, but they told me to come hack... any night after nine, and bring a
      friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll walk around with you,&rdquo; William Williams remarked negligently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not on three nickles. They told me to fetch around a couple of bottles of
      port wine, and have a genuine party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony Ball listened with rapidly growing attention, while he fingered
      three one dollar bills wadded into the bottom of his pocket. He felt his
      blood stir more rapidly, beating in his ears: vague pictures thronged his
      brain of girls with flaming hair, dexterous, flashing limbs, white frills,
      garters. With an elaborate air of unconcern he asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they goodlookers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Boy! they have got that hidden fascination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony made a swift reckoning of the price of port; it would wipe out the
      sum he was getting together for badly needed baseball shoes.&mdash;Red
      hair!&mdash;He could count on no further assistance from his father that
      month; the machine shop at present was an expense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got any coin?&rdquo; Meredith demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A few.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other consulted with importance the ostentatious watch. &ldquo;Just the
      minute,&rdquo; he announced. &ldquo;Come along; we can get the port at the Eagle;
      we'll have a Paris of a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Allhop offered an epigrammatic parallel between two celebrated
      planets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I need new ball shoes,&rdquo; Anthony temporized; &ldquo;I ripped mine the last
      game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meredith rose impatiently. &ldquo;Charge them to the family,&rdquo; he ejaculated.
      &ldquo;But if you don't want to get in on this, there are plenty of others. Two
      or three dollars are easy to raise in a good cause. Why, the last night I
      spent in the city cost me seventeen bucks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I'll come.&rdquo; Anthony instinctively barred his sudden eagerness
      from his voice. He rose, and was surprised to find that his knees were
      trembling. His face was hot too.&mdash;he wondered if it was red? if it
      would betray his inexperience? &ldquo;If they hand me any Sundayschool stuff,&rdquo;
       he proclaimed bigly, &ldquo;I'll step right on it; I'm considerably wise to
      these dames.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the real, ruffled goods.&rdquo; Meredith settled a straw hat with a
      blue band on his sleek head, and Anthony dragged a faded cap from his
      pocket, which he drew far over his eyes. William Williams regarded them
      enviously. Craik's thoughts had wandered far, his lips moved silently. And
      Doctor Allhop had disappeared into the front of the drugstore.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ET'S get along,&rdquo;
       Anthony said in a a thick, strange voice. He stumbled forward; his eyes
      were hot, blurred; he tried in vain to wink clear his vision. Suddenly his
      elbow struck sharply against a shelf, and there was an answering crash,
      the splintering of glass smashing upon the floor. Doctor Allhop hurried in
      to the scene of the disaster. &ldquo;You young bull among the bottles!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed in exasperated tones; &ldquo;a whole gross of perfume, all the white
      lilac, lost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony Ball stood motionless, embarrassed and annoyed by the accident;
      and great, heavy coils of the scent rose about him; they filled his
      nostrils with wave on wave of pungent odor, and stung his eyes so that he
      shut them. The scent seemed to press about him, to obstruct his breathing,
      weigh upon his heart; he put out a hand as if to ward it off. It seemed to
      him that great masses of the flower surrounded him, shutting him with a
      white, sweet wall from the world. He swayed dizzily; then vanquished the
      illusion with an expression of regret for the damage he had wrought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Doctor was on his knees, brushing together the debris; William
      Williams guffawed; and Craik smiled idly. Meredith swore, tapping a
      cigarette on his silver case. &ldquo;You're a parlor ornament, you are,&rdquo; he told
      Anthony.
    </p>
    <p>
      A feeling of impotence enveloped the latter, a sullen resentment against
      an occurrence the inevitable result of which must descend like a shower of
      cold water upon his freshly-stirred desires. &ldquo;I am sorry as hell, Doctor,&rdquo;
       he repeated; &ldquo;what did that box cost you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six seventy,&rdquo; Allhop shot impatiently over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony produced his three dollars, and, smoothing them, laid the sum on a
      table. &ldquo;I will stop in with the rest to-morrow morning,&rdquo; he said. The
      Doctor rose and turned, partly mollified; but, to avoid the argument
      which, he felt, might follow, Anthony strode quickly out into the
      drugstore. There at the white marble sodawater fountain a bevy of youth
      was consuming colorific cones of ice cream, drinking syrupy concoctions
      from tall, glistening glasses. They called him by name, but he passed them
      without a sign of recognition, still the victim of his jangling
      sensibilities.

    <h2>
      III
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>AY STREET was
      thronged; the shops displayed broad, lighted windows filled with their
      various merchandise; in front of a produce store a row of chickens hung
      bare, bright blue and yellow, head down; from within came the grinding of
      a coffee machine, the acrid voices of women bargaining. The glass doors to
      the fire-engine house stood open, the machines glimmering behind a wide
      demilune of chairs holding a motley assemblage of men. Further along, from
      above, came the shuffle of dancing feet, the thin, wiry wail of violins.
      At the corners groups of youths congregated, obstructing the passerby,
      smirking and indulging in sudden, stridulous hursts of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky was infinitely remote, intensely, tenderly blue, the stars white
      as milk; from the immediately surrounding countryside came the scented
      breaths of early summer&mdash;the trailing sweetness of locust blooms, of
      hidden hedges of honeysuckle, of June roses, and all the pungent aroma of
      growing grasses, leaves, of fragile and momentary flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony made his way brusquely through the throng, nodding shortly to the
      countless salutations that marked his progress. The youths all knew him,
      and the majority of the men; women stopped in their sharp haggling to
      smile at him; garlands of girls gay in muslins &ldquo;Mistered&rdquo; him with pretty
      propriety, or followed him more boldly over their shoulders with inviting
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He impatiently disregarded his facile popularity: the tumult within him
      settled into a dull, unreasoning anger against the universe at large. He
      still owed Doctor Allhop four dollars and seventy cents; he had told the
      Doctor that he would pay to-morrow; and he would have to go to his father.
      The latter was a rigorously just man, Anthony gladly recognized, the money
      would be instantly forthcoming; but he was not anxious to recall the
      deficiencies of his present position to his father just then. He had
      passed twenty, and&mdash;beyond his ability to cause a baseball to travel
      in certain unexpected tangents, and a limited comprehension of the conduct
      of automobiles&mdash;he was totally without assets, and without any light
      on the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been willing to work, he reminded himself resentfully, but bad luck
      had overtaken him at every turn. The venture before the machine shop&mdash;a
      scheme of squabs, the profits of which, calculated from an advertisement,
      soared with the birthrate of those prolific birds, had been ruined by
      rats. The few occasions when he had neglected to feed the pigeons, despite
      the frank and censorious opinion of the family, had had little or nothing
      to do with that misfortune. And, before that, his kennel of rabbit dogs
      had met with an untimely fate when a favorite bitch had gone mad, and a
      careful commonwealth had decreed the death of the others. If his mother
      could but be won from the negative she had placed upon baseball as a
      professional occupation, he might easily rise through the minor leagues to
      a prideful position in the ranks of the national pastime&mdash;&ldquo;Lonnie
      This&rdquo; was paid fourteen hundred yearly for his prowess with the leather
      sphere, &ldquo;Hans That's&rdquo; removal from one to another club had involved
      thousands of dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard his name pronounced in a peremptory manner, and stopped to see
      the relative whose automobile had been placed in his care cross the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What in the name of the Lord have you young dunces done to my car?&rdquo; the
      older man demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have been trying to locate that grinding,&rdquo; Anthony told him in as
      conciliatory manner as he could assume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the other proceeded angrily, &ldquo;you have ruined it this time; the
      gears slid around like a plate of ice cream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was nothing but a pile of junk when we took it,&rdquo; Tony exploded; &ldquo;why
      don't you loosen up and get a real car?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I took it to Feedler's. You can send me a bill to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There will be no bill. I'm sorry you were not satisfied, Sam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are the most shiftless young dog in the county,&rdquo; the other told him
      in kindlier tones; &ldquo;why don't you take hold of something, Anthony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony swung on his heel and abruptly departed. He had taken hold, he
      thought hotly, times without number, but everything broke in his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stores on Bay Street grew more infrequent, the rank of monotonous
      brick dwellings closed up, family groups occupied the steps that led to
      the open doors. The crowd grew less, dwindling to a few aimless couples,
      solitary pedestrians. He soon stopped, before his home. Opposite the gaunt
      skeleton of a building operation rose blackly against the pale stars. The
      aged lindens above him, lushly leaved, cast an intenser gloom, filled with
      the warm, musty odor of the sluiced pavement, about the white marble
      steps. The hall, open before him, was a cavern of coolness; beyond, from
      the garden shut from the street by an intricate, rusting iron fence, he
      heard the deliberate tones of his sister Ellie. Evidently there was a
      visitor, and he entered the hall noiselessly, intent upon passing without
      notice to his room above. But Ellie had been watching for him, and called
      before he had reached the foot of the stairs.

      IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E made his way
      diffidently through a long window to the lawn; where he saw his sister, a
      glimmering, whitish shape in the heavily overgrown garden, conversing with
      a figure without form or detail, by a trellis sagging beneath a verdurous
      weight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Tony!&rdquo; she called; &ldquo;here's Mrs. Dreen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned forward awkwardly, and grasped a slim, jewelled hand. &ldquo;I didn't
      know you were back from France,&rdquo; he told the indistinct woman before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you read that Mr. Dreen had resigned the consulship at Lyons,&rdquo; a
      delicate, rounded voice rejoined, &ldquo;and you should have guessed that we
      would come home to Ellerton. My dear Ellie,&rdquo; she turned to the girl, &ldquo;you
      have no idea how delighted James is at being here once more. He has given
      the farmer notice, and insists that he is going to cultivate his own
      acres. He was up this morning at six; fancy, after France and his late <i>déjeuner.</i>
      And Eliza adores it; she spends the day with a gardener, planning
      flowerbeds.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony slipped into an easy posture on the thick, damp sod. Although he
      had not seen Mrs. James Dreen since his childhood, when she had
      accompanied her husband abroad to a consular post, he still retained a
      pleasant memory of her magnetic and precise charm, the memory of her
      harmonious personality, the beauty of her apparel and rings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Eliza?&rdquo; he asked politely, and with no inward interest; &ldquo;she must
      be a regular beauty by now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Mrs. Dreen returned crisply, &ldquo;she is not particularly goodlooking,
      but she has always told me the truth. Eliza is a dear.&rdquo; Anthony lit a
      cigarette, and flipped the match in a minute gold arc, extinguished in the
      night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am decidedly uneasy about Eliza though,&rdquo; she continued to Ellie; &ldquo;to
      tell the truth, I am not sure how she will take over here. She is a
      serious child; I would say temperamental, but that's such an impossible
      word. She is absolutely and transparently honest and outspoken&mdash;it's
      <i>ghastly</i> at times. The most unworldly person alive; with her thought
      and action are one, and often as not her thoughts are appalling. All that,
      you know, doesn't spell wisdom for a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet James and I couldn't bear to... make her harder. A great deal of
      care... If she is my daughter, Ellie, she is exquisite&mdash;so sensitive,
      sympathetic...&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony, absorbed in the misfortune that had overtaken the machine shop,
      the impending, inevitable interview with his father, so justly rigorous,
      hardly gathered the sense of Mrs. Dreen's discourse. Occasional phrases,
      familiar and unfamiliar terms, pierced his abstraction.&mdash;&ldquo;Colombin's.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;James' siatica.&rdquo; &ldquo;Camille Marchais.&rdquo; Then her words, centering about a
      statement that had captured his attention, became coherent, significant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a small affair,&rdquo; Mrs. Dreen explained; &ldquo;to introduce Eliza to
      Ellerton. Nothing on a large scale until winter.... Dancing, or rather
      what goes down for dancing to-day. I am asking our old intimates, and have
      written a few informal cards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An automobile drew up smoothly before the Balls; its rear light winked
      like an angry red eye through the iron fence. Mrs. Dreen rose. In the
      gloom her face was girlish; there was a blur of lace at her throat, a
      glimmer of emeralds. &ldquo;Mind you come,&rdquo; she commanded Ellie. &ldquo;And you too,
      without fail,&rdquo; to Anthony. &ldquo;Now that Hydrangea House is open again we must
      have our friends about us. Heavens! Howard Ball's children and mine grown
      up!&rdquo; She moved gracefully across to a garden gate. Anthony assisted her
      into the motorcar; the door closed with a snap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellie had sunk back into her chair, and was idly twisting her fingers in
      the grass at her side. At her back the ivied wall of the house beyond
      stirred faintly with sparrows. A misshapen moon swung apparently up from
      and through the building frame opposite, and faint shadows unfolded on the
      grass. Anthony flung himself moodily by his sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam's taken his car from us,&rdquo; he informed her; &ldquo;that will about shut up
      the shop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then perhaps you will bring back the screwdrivers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you going to do, Tony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A big strong fellow... there mast be something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother won't let me play ball in the leagues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she will; we'll talk to her; it's better than nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I broke a box of rotten perfume at the drugstore, and owe the Doctor four
      seventy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too bad&mdash;father is never free from little worries; you are
      always getting into difficulties. You are different from other boys,
      Anthony&mdash;there don't seem to be any place in life for you; or you
      don't make a place, I can't tell which. You have no constructive sense,
      and no feeling of responsibility. What do you want to do with yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Ellie, honestly,&rdquo; he confessed. &ldquo;I try like the devil, make
      a thousand resolutions, and then&mdash;I go off fishing. Or if I don't
      things go to the rats just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she rose, &ldquo;I'm going up. Don't bother father about that money,
      I'll let you have it. It's perfectly useless to tell you to return it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I swear you will get it next week,&rdquo; he proclaimed gratefully. &ldquo;The
      baseball association owes me for two games.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Haven't you promised it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so!&rdquo; he exclaimed ruefully. She laughed and disappeared into the
      house.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> BLACK depression
      settled over him; life appeared a huge conspiracy against his success, his
      happiness. The future, propounded by Ellie, was suddenly stripped of all
      glamor, denuded of all optimistic dreams; he passed through one of those
      dismaying periods when the world, himself, his pretentions, were revealed
      in the clear and pitiless light of reality. His friends, his
      circumstances, his hopes, held out no promise, no thought of pleasure.
      Behind him his life lay revealed as a series of failures, before him it
      was plotted without security. The plan, the order, that others saw, or
      said that they saw, presented to him only a cloudy confusion. The rewards
      for which others struggled, aspired, which they found indispensable, had
      been ever meaningless to him&mdash;to money he never gave a thought; a
      society organized into calls, dancing, incomprehensible and petty values,
      never rose above his horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was happiest in the freedom of the open, the woods; in the easy company
      of casual friends, black or white, kindly comment. He would spend a day
      with his dogs and gun, sitting on a stump in a snowy field, listening to
      the eager yelping in the distant, blue wood, shooting a rare rabbit. Or
      tramping tirelessly the leafy paths of autumn. Or, better still, swinging
      through the miry October swales, coonhunting after midnight with lantern
      and climbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      But now those pleasures, in anticipated retrospect, appeared bald,
      unprofitable. Prolonged indefinitely, he divined, they would pall; they
      did not offer adequate material, aim, for the years. For a moment he saw,
      grinning hatefully at him, the spectre of what he might become; he passed
      such men, collarless and unshaven, on the street comers, flinging them a
      scornful salutation. He had paid for their drinks, hearkening negligently
      to their stereotyped stories, secretly gibing at their obvious
      goodfellowship, their eager, tremulous smiles. They had been, in their
      day, great rabbit hunters... detestable.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mood vanished, the present closed mercifully about him, leaving him
      merely defiant. The townclock announced the hour in slow, jarring notes. A
      light shone above from Ellie's room, and he heard his father's deliberate
      footsteps in the hall, returning from the Ellerton Club, where, as was his
      invariable nightly habit, he had played cooncan. The moon, freed from the
      towering beams, was without color.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony rose, and flung away a cold, stale cigarette; the world was just
      like that&mdash;stale and cold. He proceeded toward the house, when he
      heard footfalls on the pavement; in the obscurity he barely made out a man
      and woman, walking so closely as to be hardly distinguishably separate.
      They stopped by the fence, only a few feet from where he stood concealed
      in the shadows, and the man took the woman's hands in his own, bending
      over her. Then, suddenly, clasping her in his arms, he covered her
      upturned face with passionate kisses. With a little, frightened gasp she
      clung to his shoulders. The kisses ceased. Their strained, desperate
      embrace remained unbroken.&mdash;It seemed that each was the only reality
      for the other in a world of unsubstantial gloom, veiled in the shifting,
      silvery mist of a cold and removed planet. The woman breathed with a deep,
      sobbing inspiration; and, when she spoke, Anthony realized that he was
      eavesdropping, and walked swiftly and cautiously into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the memory of that embrace; accompanied him up the stairs, into his
      room. It haunted him as he lay, cool and nearly bare, on his bed. It
      filled him with a profound and unreasoning melancholy, new to his
      customary, unconscious animal exuberance. All at once he thought of the
      redhaired girl who liked port wine; and, as he fell asleep, she stood
      before him, leering slyly at the side of that other broken shape which
      threatened him out of the future.

      VI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE shed that held
      the machine shop and garage fronted upon an informal lane skirting the
      verdurous border of the town. Beyond the fence opposite a broad pasturage
      dipped and rose to the blackened ruins of a considerable brick mansion,
      now tenanted by a provident colony of Italians; further hill topped green
      hill, the orchards drawn like silvery scarves about their shoulders,
      undulating to the sky. Back of the shed ranged the red roofs and tree-tops
      of the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Anthony arrived at the seat of his industry the grass was flashing
      with dew and the air a thrill with the buoyant piping of robins. He found
      the door open, and Alfred Craik awaiting him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's gone,&rdquo; Alfred informed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sam told me last night; it was your infernal tinkering... you can't let a
      machine alone,&rdquo; Anthony dropped beside the other on the door sill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could we get another car, do you think?&rdquo; Alfred demanded; &ldquo;I had almost
      finished a humming experiment on Sam's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This garage is closed,&rdquo; Anthony pronounced; &ldquo;it's out of existence. The
      family are yelping for the screwdrivers. What do we owe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three ninety to Feedler for 'gas,' and a month's rent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're bankrupt,&rdquo; the other immediately declared. He rose, and proceeded
      to collect the tools that littered the floor; then he removed the sign,
      &ldquo;Ball and Craik. Machine Shop and Garage.&rdquo;, from the door, and the shed
      relapsed into its nondescript, somnolent decay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a game with Honeydale to-day,&rdquo; Anthony resumed his seat; &ldquo;I'm to
      pitch that, and another Saturday; and, hear me, boy, I need the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Alfred gazed over the orchards, beyond the hills, into the sky, and made
      no answer. It was evident that he was lost in a vision of gloriously
      disrupted machinery. His silence spread to Anthony, who settled back with
      a cigarette into the drowsy stillness. The minutes passed, hovering like
      bees, and merged into an hour. They could hear a horse champing in the
      pasture; the wail of an Italian infant came to them thinly across the
      green; behind them sounded mellow the tin horn of the shad vendor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony roused himself reluctantly, recalling the debt he had to discharge
      at the drugstore. Elbe's crisp five dollar bill lay in his pocket.
      &ldquo;Later,&rdquo; he nodded, and made his way over the shady brick pavements,
      through the cool perspective of maple-lined streets, where summer dresses
      fluttered in spots of subdued, bright color, to Doctor Allhop's. The
      Doctor was absent, and Anthony tendered the money, with a short
      explanation, to the clerk. The latter smartly rang the amount on the cash
      register, and placed thirty cents on the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two packs of Dulcinas,&rdquo; Anthony required, and dropped the cigarettes into
      his pocket. He made his way in a leisurely fashion toward home and the
      midday meal. At the table his mother's keen grey eyes regarded him with
      affectionate concern. &ldquo;How do you feel, Tony?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;You were
      coughing last night... take such wretched care of yourself&mdash;&rdquo; His
      father glanced up from the half-masted sheet of the Ellerton <i>Bugle</i>.
      He was a spare man, of few words, with a square-cut beard about the lower
      part of an austere countenance. &ldquo;What's the matter with him?&rdquo; he demanded
      crisply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Anthony hastily protested; &ldquo;you ought to know mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After lunch he extended himself smoking on the horsehair sofa in the front
      room. It was a spacious chamber, with a polished floor, and well-worn,
      comfortable chairs; in a corner a lacquered table bore old blue Canton
      china; by the door a jar of roses dropped their pink petals; over the
      fireplace a tall mirror held all in silvery replica.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thirty cents, please,&rdquo; Ellie demanded; &ldquo;I must get some stamps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wave of conscious guilt, angry self condemnation, swept over him. &ldquo;I'm
      sorry, Ellie,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;I haven't got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stood regarding him for a moment with cold disapproval. She was a
      slender woman, past thirty, with dark, regular features and tranquil eyes;
      carelessly dressed, her hair slipped over her shoulder in a cool plait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; he repeated, &ldquo;I didn't think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it wasn't yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll get every pretty penny of it.&rdquo; He rose and in orderly discretion
      sought his room, where he changed into his worn, grey playing flannels.

    <h2>
      VII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> HIGH board fence
      enclosed the grounds of the Ellerton Baseball Association; over one side
      rose the rude scaffolding of a grandstand, protected from sun and rain by
      a covering of tarred planks; a circular opening by a narrow entrance
      framed the ticket seller; while around the base of the fence, located
      convenient to a small boy's eye, ran a girdle of unnatural knotholes,
      highly improved cracks, through which an occasional fleeting form might be
      observed, a segment of torn sod, and the fence opposite.
    </p>
    <p>
      A shallow flood of spectators, drawn from the various quarters of the
      town, converged in a dense stream at the entrance to the Grounds; troops
      of girls with brightly-hued ribbands about their vivacious arms,
      boisterous or superior squads of young males, alternated with their more
      sober elders&mdash;shabby and dejected men, out at elbows and work, in
      search of the respite of the sun and the play; baseball enthusiasts,
      rotund individuals with ruddy countenances, saturnine experts with
      scorecards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony observed the throng indifferently as he drew near the scene of his
      repeated, past triumphs, the metal plates in his shoes grinding into the
      pavement. A small procession followed him, led by a colored youth, to
      whose dilapidated garments clung the unmistakable straws and aroma of the
      stable, bearing aloft Anthony's glove, and &ldquo;softing&rdquo; it vigorously from a
      natural source; a boy as round and succulent as a boiled pudding, with
      Anthony's cap beneath his arm, leaving behind him a trail of peanut
      shells, brought up the rear of this democratic escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little question in Anthony's mind of his ability to triumph that
      afternoon over his opponents from a near-by town; their &ldquo;battery,&rdquo; he told
      himself, was an open book to him&mdash;a slow, dropping ball here, a
      speedy one across the fingers of that red-haired fielder who habitually
      flinched... and yet he wished that it had not been so hot. He thought of
      the game without particular pleasure; he was conscious of a lack of
      energy; his thoughts, occupied with Elli's patent contempt, stung him
      waspishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A throng of players and hangerson filled the contracted dressing quarters
      beneath the grandstand, and he was instantly surrounded by vociferous
      familiars. The captain of the Ellerton team drew him aside, and tersely
      outlined a policy of play, awaiting his opinion. Anthony nodded gravely:
      suddenly he found the other's earnestness a little absurd&mdash;the fate
      of a nation appeared to color his accents, to hang upon the result of his
      decision. &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; he said absently, &ldquo;keep the field in; they won't hit
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other regarded him with a slight frown. &ldquo;Hate yourself to-day, don't
      you?&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Lay that crowd cold on the plate, though,&rdquo; he added;
      &ldquo;there's a man here from the major league to look you over. Hinkle told my
      old man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A quickening of interest took possession of Anthony; they had heard of him
      then in the cities, they had discovered him worthy of the journey to
      Ellerton, of investigation. A vision of his name acclaimed from coast to
      coast, his picture in the playing garb of a famous organization filling
      the Sunday sheets, occupied his mind as he turned toward the field. The
      captain called mysteriously, &ldquo;Don't get patted up with any purple stuff
      handed you before the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The opposing team, widely scattered, were warming; a pitcher, assuming the
      attitudes of an agonising cramp, was indulging in a preliminary practice;
      the ball sped with a dull, regular thud into the catcher's mit. A ball was
      tossed to Anthony, a team mate backed against the fence, and, raising his
      hands on high, he apparently overcame all the natural laws of flight. He
      was conscious of Hinkle, prosperous proprietor of the Ellerton Pool
      Parlor, at his back with a stranger, an ungainly man, close lipped, keen
      of vision. There were intimations of approval. &ldquo;A fine wing,&rdquo; the stranger
      said. &ldquo;He's got 'em all,&rdquo; Hinkle declared. &ldquo;Hundreds of lads can pitch a
      good game,&rdquo; the other told him, &ldquo;now and again, they are amatoors. One in
      a thousand, in ten thousand, can play ball all the time; they're
      professionals; they're worth money... I want to see him act...&rdquo; they moved
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The players were called in from the field, the captains bent over a tossed
      coin; and, first to bat, the Ellerton team ranged itself on benches. Then,
      as the catcher was drawing on his mask, Hinkle and another familiar town
      figure, who dedicated his days to speeding weedy horses in red flannel
      anklets from a precarious wire vehicle, stepped forward from the
      grandstand. &ldquo;Mr. Anthony Ball!&rdquo; Hinkle called. A sudden, tense silence
      enveloped the spectators, the players stopped curiously. Anthony turned
      with mingled reluctance and surprise. Something shone in Hinkle's hand: he
      saw that it was a watch. &ldquo;As a testimonial from your Ellerton friends,&rdquo;
       the other commenced loudly. Anthony's confused mind lost part of the short
      oration which followed &ldquo;... recognition of your sportsmanship and skill...
      happy disposition. The good fame of the Ellerton Baseball team... predict
      great future on the national diamond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A storm of applause from the grandstand rippled away in opposite
      directions along the line sitting by the fence; boys with their mouths
      full of fingers whistled incredibly. Hinkle held out the watch, but
      Anthony's eyes were fixed upon the ground. He shook the substantial mark
      of Ellerton's approval, so that the ornate fob glittered in the sun, but
      Anthony's arms remained motionless at his sides. &ldquo;Take it, you
      leatherkop,&rdquo; a voice whispered fiercely in his ear. 'And with a start, he
      awkwardly grasped the gift. &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he muttered, his voice inaudible
      five yards away. He wished with passionate resentment that the fiend who
      was yelling &ldquo;speech!&rdquo; would drop dead. He glanced up, and the sight of all
      those excited, kindly faces deepened his confusion until it rose in a lump
      in his throat, blurred his vision, in an idiotic, childish manner. &ldquo;Ah, <i>call</i>
      the game, can't you,&rdquo; he urged over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first half inning was soon over, without incident; and, as Anthony
      walked to the pitcher's &ldquo;box,&rdquo; the necessity to surpass all previous
      efforts was impressed upon him by the watch, by the presence of that
      spectator from a major league who had come to see him &ldquo;act.&rdquo; He wished
      again, in a passing irritation, that it had not been so hot. Behind the
      batter he could see the countenance of &ldquo;Kag&rdquo; Lippit staring through the
      wires of his mask. &ldquo;Kag&rdquo; executed a cabalistic signal with his left arm,
      and Anthony pitched. The umpire hoarsely informed the world at large that
      it had been a strike. A blast of derisive catcalls arose from the Ellerton
      partisans; another strike, shriller catcalls, and the batter retired after
      a third ineffectual lunge amid a tempest of banter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second batter hit a feeble fly negligently attached by the third
      baseman, who &ldquo;put it over to first&rdquo; in the exuberance of his contempt. The
      third Anthony disposed of with equal brevity.
    </p>
    <p>
      He next faced the pitcher, and, succumbing to the pressure of
      extraordinary events, he swung the bat with a tremendous effort, and the
      flattened ball described a wide arc into the ready palms of the right
      fielder. &ldquo;You're <i>Out!</i>&rdquo; the umpire vociferated. The uncritical
      portion of the spectators voiced their pleasure in the homeric length of
      the hit, but the captain was contemptuously cold as Anthony returned to
      the bench. &ldquo;The highschool hero,&rdquo; he remarked; &ldquo;little Willie the Wallop.
      If you don't bat to the game,&rdquo; he added in a different tone, &ldquo;if you were
      Eddie Plank I'd bench you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That inning the Ellerton team scored a run: a youth hurtling headlong
      through the dust pressed his cheek affectionately upon the dingy square of
      marble dignified by the title of home, while a second hammered him
      violently in the groin with the ball; one chorus shrieked, &ldquo;out by a
      block!&rdquo; another, &ldquo;safe! safe!&rdquo; he was &ldquo;safe as safe!&rdquo; the girls declared.
      The umpire's voice rose authoritatively above the tumult. &ldquo;Play ball! he's
      safe!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony pitched that inning faultlessly; never had ball obeyed him so
      absolutely; it dropped, swung to the right, to the left, revolved or sped
      dead. The batters faded away like ice cream at a church supper. As he came
      in from the &ldquo;box&rdquo; the close-lipped stranger strode forward and grasped his
      shoulder. &ldquo;I want to see you after the game,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;don't sign up
      with no one else. I'm from&mdash;&rdquo; he whispered his persuasive source in
      Anthony's ear. The captain commended him pithily. &ldquo;He's got 'em all,&rdquo;
       Hinkle proclaimed to the assembled throng.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Anthony batted next it was with calculated nicety; he drove the ball
      between shortstop and second base, and, by dint of hard running, achieved
      a rapturously acclaimed &ldquo;two bagger.&rdquo; The captain then merely tapped the
      ball&mdash;breathlessly it was described as a &ldquo;sacrifice&rdquo;&mdash;and
      Anthony moved to the third base, and a succeeding hit sent him &ldquo;home.&rdquo;
       Another run was added to the Ellerton score, it now stood three to nothing
      in their favor, before Anthony returned to the dusty depression from which
      he pitched.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was suddenly and unaccountably tired; the cursed heat was worse than
      ever, he thought, wiping a wet palm on his grimy leg; above him the sky
      was an unbroken, blazing expanse of blue; short, sharp shadows shifted
      under the feet of the tense players; in the shade of the grandstand the
      dresses, mostly white, showed here and there a vivid note of yellow and
      violet, the crisp note of crimson. The throbbing song of a thrush floated
      from a far hedge... it stirred him with a new unrest, dissatisfaction...
      &ldquo;Kag&rdquo; looked like a damned fool grimacing at him through the wire mask&mdash;exactly
      like a monkey in a cage. The umpire in his inflated protector, crouching
      in a position of rigorous attention, resembled a turtle. He pitched, and a
      spurt of dust rose a yard before the plate. &ldquo;Ball one!&rdquo; That wouldn't do,
      he told himself, recalling the substantially expressed confidence, esteem,
      of Ellerton. The captain's sibilant &ldquo;steady&rdquo; was like the flick of a whip.
      With an effort which taxed his every resource he marshalled his relaxed
      muscles into an aching endeavor, centred his unstable thoughts upon the
      exigencies of the play, and retired the batter before him. But he struck
      the next upon the arm, sending him, nursing the bruise, to first base. He
      saw the captain grimly wave the outfielders farther back; and, determined,
      resentful, he struck out in machinelike order the remaining batters. But
      he was unconscionably weary; his arm felt as though he had been pitching
      for a week, a month; and he dropped limp and surly upon the sod at a
      distance from the players' bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      He batted once more, but a third &ldquo;out&rdquo; on the bases saved him from the
      fluke which, he had been certain, must inevitably follow. As he stood with
      the ball in his hand, facing the batter, he was conscious of an air of
      uncertainty spreading like a contagion through the Ellerton team; he
      recognized that it radiated from himself&mdash;his lack of confidence
      magnified to a promised panic. The centre fielder fumbled a fly directly
      in his hands; there was a shout from Ellerton's opponents, silence in the
      ranks of Ellerton.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony pitched with a tremendous effort, his arm felt brittle; it felt as
      though it was made of glass, and would break off. He could put no speed
      into the ball, his fingers seemed swollen, he was unable to grip it
      properly, control its direction. The red-haired player whom he had
      despised faced him, he who habitually flinched, and Anthony essayed to
      drive the ball across his fingers. The bat swung with a vicious crack upon
      the leather sphere, a fielder ran vainly back, back....
    </p>
    <p>
      The runner passed first base, and, wildly urged by a small but adequately
      vocal group of wellwishers, scorned second base, repudiated third, from
      which another player tallied a run, and loafed magnificently &ldquo;home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From the fence some one called to Anthony, &ldquo;what time is it?&rdquo; and achieved
      a huge success among the opposition. His captain besought him desperately
      to &ldquo;come back. Where's your pep' went? you're pitching like a dead man!&rdquo;
       Confusion fell upon the team in the field, and, in its train, a series of
      blunders which cost five runs. After the inning Anthony stood with a
      lowered, moody countenance. &ldquo;You're out of this game,&rdquo; the captain shot at
      him; &ldquo;go home and play with mother and the girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the field under a dropping fire of witticisms, feebly stemmed by
      half-hearted applause; Hinkle frowned heavily at him; the man from the
      major league had gone. Anthony proceeded directly through the gate and
      over the street toward home. The taste of profound Humiliation, of
      failure, was bitter in his mouth, that failure which seemed to lie at the
      heart of everything he attempted, which seemed to follow him like his
      shadow, like the malicious influence of a powerful spite, an enmity
      personal and unrelenting. The sun centred its heat upon his bared head
      with an especial fervor; the watch, thrust hastily in a pocket, swung
      against his leg mockingly; the abrupt departure of that keeneyed spectator
      added its hurt to his self pride.

      surly silence throughout dinner; but later, on discovering a dress shirt
      laid in readiness on his bed, and recalling the purport of Mrs. James
      Dreen's call, he announced on the crest of an overwhelming exasperation
      that he would go to no condemmed dance. &ldquo;Ellie can't go alone,&rdquo; his mother
      told him from the landing below; &ldquo;and do hurry, Tony, she's almost
      dressed.&rdquo; The flaring gas jet seemed to coat his room with a heavy yellow
      dust; the night came in at the window as thickly purple as though it had
      been paint squeezed from a tube. He slowly assembled his formal clothes.
      An extended search failed to reveal the whereabouts of his studs, and he
      pressed into service the bone buttons inserted by the laundry. The shirt
      was intolerably hot and uncomfortable, his trousers tight, a white
      waistcoat badly shrunken; but a collar with a frayed and iron-like edge
      the crowning misery. When, finally, he was garbed, he felt as though he
      had been compressed into an iron boiler; a stream of perspiration coursed
      down the exact middle of his back; his tie hung in a limp knot. Fiery
      epithets escaped at frequent intervals.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the contrary, Ellie was delightfully cool, orderly; she waved a lacy
      fan in her long, delicate fingers. The public vehicle engaged to convey
      them to the Dreens, a mile or more beyond the town, drew up at the door
      with a clatter of hoofs. It was an aged hack, with complaining joints, and
      a loose iron tire. A musty smell rose from the threadbare cushions, the
      rotting leather. The horse's hoofs were now muffled in the dusty country
      road; shadowy hedges were passed, dim, white farmhouses with orange,
      lighted windows, the horizon outspread in a shimmering blue circle under
      the swimming stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony smoked a cigarette in acute misery; already his neck felt scraped
      raw; a button flew jubilantly from his waistcoat; and his improvised studs
      failed in their appointed task. &ldquo;I'm having the hell of a good time, I
      am,&rdquo; he told Ellie satirically.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned between stone pillars supporting a lighted grill, advanced
      over a winding driveway to Hydrangea House, where they waited for a motor
      to move from the brilliantly-illuminated portal. A servant directed
      Anthony to the second floor, where he found a bedchamber temporarily in
      service as coat room, occupied by a number of <i>men</i>. Most of them he
      knew, and nodded shortly in return to their careless salutations. They
      belonged to a variety that he at once envied and disdained: here they were
      thoroughly at ease, their ties irreproachable, their shirts without a
      crease. Drawing on snowy gloves they discussed women and society with
      fluency, gusto, emanating an atmosphere of cocktails.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony produced his gloves in a crumpled wad from the tail of his coat
      and fought his way into them. He felt rather than saw the restrained
      amusement of his fellows. They spoke to him gravely, punctiliously
      proffered cigarettes; yet, in a vague but unmistakable manner, he was made
      to feel that he was outside their interests, ignorant of their shibboleth.
      In the matter of collars alone he was as a Patagonian to them. He recalled
      with regret the easy familiarity, the comfort, of Doctor Allhop's
      drugstore.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, throwing aside cigarettes, patting waistcoats into position, they
      streamed down to the music. The others found partners immediately, and
      swung into a onestep, but Anthony stood irresolutely in the doorway. The
      girls disconcerted him with their formal smiles, their bright, ready
      chatter. But Ellie rescued him, drawing him into the dance. After which he
      sought the porch that, looped with rosevines, crossed the face of the
      long, low house. There, with his back against a pillar, he found a cool
      spot upon the tiles, and sought such comfort as he could command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Long windows opening from the ballroom were now segments of whirling
      color, now filled with gay streams, ebbing and returning. Fragmentary
      conversation, glowing cigarettes, surrounded him. Behind the pillar at his
      back a girl said, softly, &ldquo;please don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw Ellie, obviously searching for him, and he rose. At her side
      was a slim figure with a cloud of light hair. &ldquo;There he is!&rdquo; Ellie
      exclaimed; &ldquo;Eliza... my brother, Anthony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw that her eyes opened widely, and that her hair was a peculiar,
      bright shade. Ginger-colored, he thought. &ldquo;I made Ellie find you,&rdquo; she
      told him; &ldquo;you know, you must ask me to dance; I won't be ignored at my
      own party.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He muttered awkwardly some conventional period, annoyed at having been
      found, intensely uncomfortable. In a minute more he found himself dancing,
      conscious of his limp tie, his crumpled and gaping shirt. He swung his
      partner heavily across the room, colliding with a couple that he
      shouldered angrily aside. The animation swiftly died from Eliza Dreen's
      countenance; she grew indifferent, then cold. And, when the music ceased,
      she escaped with a palpable sigh of relief. He was savagely mopping his
      heated face on the porch when, at his elbow, a clear voice captured his
      attention. &ldquo;A dreadful person,&rdquo; it said, &ldquo;... like dancing with a
      locomotive... A regular Apache.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned and saw that it was Eliza Dreen, gathering from her swift
      concern both that he had been the subject of her discourse, and that she
      was aware that he had overheard it. Back at his post at the pillar he
      promised himself grimly that never again would he be found in such
      specified company. He stripped his gloves from his wet palms, and flung
      them far across the lawn, then recklessly eased his collar. There was a
      sudden whisper of skirts behind him, when Eliza seated herself on the
      porch's edge, at his side.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> AM a loathsome
      person at times,&rdquo; she informed him; &ldquo;and to-night I was rather worse than
      usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do dance like a&mdash;locomotive,&rdquo; involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter how you dance,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;and you mustn't repeat
      it, it isn't generous.&rdquo; Suddenly she laughed uncontrollably. &ldquo;You looked
      so uncomfortable... your collar,&rdquo; it was lost in a bubbling, silvery peal.
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind,&rdquo; he assured her. All at once he didn't; the sting had
      vanished from his pride; he smiled. He saw that she wore a honey-colored
      dress, with a strand of pearls about her slim throat, and that her feet,
      in satin, were even smaller than Ellie's. Her hair resembled more a crown
      of light than the customary adornment. &ldquo;I didn't want to come,&rdquo; he
      confided: &ldquo;I hate, well&mdash;going out, dancing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't suit you,&rdquo; she admitted frankly; &ldquo;you are so splendidly
      bronzed and strong; you need,&rdquo; she paused, &ldquo;lots of room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For this Anthony had no adequate reply. &ldquo;I have this with some one,&rdquo; she
      declared as the music recommenced, &ldquo;but I hope they don't find me; I hate
      it for the moment... I'll show you a place; it's very wicked of me.&rdquo; She
      rose and, waving him to follow, slipped over the grass. Beyond the house
      she stopped in the shadowy vista of a pergola; vines shut out the stars,
      walled them in a virid, still gloom. She sank on a low stone bench, and he
      found the grass at her feet. A mantle of fine romance descended upon his
      shoulders, of subtile adventure, prodigious daring. Immaculate men,
      pearl-studded, were searching for her, and she had hidden herself from
      them with him. A new and pleasant sense of importance warmed him,
      flattered his self-esteem. He felt strangely at ease, and sat in silent
      contentment. The faint sound of violins, a burst of distant laughter,
      floated to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems as if the world were rushing on, out there, without us,&rdquo; Eliza
      finally broke the silence, &ldquo;as if they were keeping a furious pace, while
      we sat in some everlasting, quiet wood, like Fontainebleau. Don't you
      adore nature?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knock about a lot outside,&rdquo; he admitted cautiously, &ldquo;often I stay out
      all night, by the Wingohocking Creek. There's a sort of cave where you can
      hear the falls, and the owls hunting about. I cook things in clay&mdash;fish,
      chickens,&rdquo; he paused abruptly at the latter item, recalling the
      questionable source of his supply. &ldquo;In winter I shoot rabbits with Bert
      Woods, he's a barber, and Doctor Allhop, you know&mdash;the druggist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sure that your friends are very nice,&rdquo; she promptly assured him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bert's crazy about girls,&rdquo; he remarked, half contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you... don't care for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know anything about them,&rdquo; he admitted with an abrupt,
      unconscious honesty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But there must have been&mdash;there must be&mdash;one,&rdquo; she persisted.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward, and he met her gaze with unwavering candor. &ldquo;Not that
      many,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be wonderful to care for just one person, <i>always</i>,&rdquo; she
      continued intently: &ldquo;I had a dream when I was quite young.... I dreamed
      that a marvellous happiness would follow a constancy like that. Father
      rather laughs at me, and quotes Shakespeare&mdash;the 'one foot on land
      and one on shore' thing. Perhaps, but it's too bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony gravely considered this new idea in relation to his own, hitherto
      lamented, lack of experience. It dawned upon him that the idea of manly
      success he had cherished would appear distasteful to Eliza Dreen. She had
      indirectly extolled the very thing of which he had been secretly ashamed.
      He thought in conjunction with her of the familiar group at the drugstore,
      and in this light the latter retreat suffered a disconcerting change:
      Thomas Meredith appeared sly and trivial, and unhealthy; Williams an empty
      braggard; Craik ineffectual, untidy. He surveyed himself without
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are different from any one I ever knew,&rdquo; he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there are millions of me,&rdquo; she returned; &ldquo;but you are different. I
      didn't like you for a sou at first; but there is something about you like&mdash;like
      a very clear spring of water. That's idiotic, but it's what I mean. There
      is an early morning feeling about you. I am very sensitive to people,&rdquo; she
      informed him, &ldquo;some make me uncomfortable directly they come into the
      room. There was a curé at Etretat I perfectly detested, and he turned out
      to be an awful person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her name was called unmistakably across the lawn, and she rose. &ldquo;They're
      all furious,&rdquo; she announced, without moving further. Her face was pale,
      immaterial, in the gloom; her wide eyes dark, disturbing. A minute gold
      watch on her wrist ticked faintly, and&mdash;it seemed to Anthony&mdash;in
      furious haste. Something within him, struggling inarticulately for
      expression, hurt; an oppressive emotion beat upon his heart. He uttered a
      period about seeing her again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some day you may show me the place where the fall sounds and the owls
      hunt. No, don't come with me.&rdquo; She turned and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      An unreasoning conviction seized Anthony that a momentous occasion had
      overtaken him; he was unable to distinguish its features, discover it
      grave or gay; but, wrapped in the impenetrable veil of the future, it
      enveloped and permeated him, swept in the circle of his blood's
      circulation, vibrated in the cords of his sensitive ganglia. He returned
      slowly to the house: the brilliantly-lit, dancing figures seemed the mere
      figments of a febrile dream; but the music apparently throbbed within his
      brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ellie's cool voice recreated his actual sphere. He found their hack, the
      driver slumbering doubled on the seat. The latter rose stiffly, and
      stirred his drowsing animal into a stumbling walk. Beyond the illuminated
      entrance to Hydrangea House the countryside lay profoundly dim to where
      the horizon flared with the pale reflection of distant lightning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eliza's a sweet,&rdquo; Ellie pronounced. Anthony brooded without reply upon
      his opinion. The iron-like collar had capitulated, and rested limply upon
      his limp shirt; at the sacrifice of a second button his waistcoat offered
      complete comfort. &ldquo;I am going to get a new dress suit,&rdquo; he announced
      decisively. Ellie smiled with sisterly malice. &ldquo;Eliza is a sweet,&rdquo; she
      reiterated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go to thunder!&rdquo; he retorted. But, &ldquo;she's wonderful,&rdquo; he admitted, and&mdash;out
      of his conclusive experience, &ldquo;there is not another girl like her in all
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll agitate for the new suit,&rdquo; Ellie promised.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE following
      morning he reorganized his neckties, left a pair of white flannels to be
      pressed at the tailor's; then, his shoulders swathed in a crisp, sprigged
      muslin, sat circumspectly under the brisk shears of Bert Woods. Bert
      hovered above him, and commented on yesterday's fiasco. &ldquo;It comes to the
      best of 'em,&rdquo; Bert assured him: &ldquo;'member how Ollie Stitcher fell down in
      the world's series at Chicago.&rdquo; He recited, for Anthony's comfort, the
      names of eminent pitchers who had &ldquo;fell down&rdquo; when every necessity
      demanded that they should have remained splendidly erect.
    </p>
    <p>
      His defeat still rankled in Anthony's mind, but the bitterness had
      vanished, the sting salved by that other memory of the impulsive charm of
      Eliza Dreen. He recalled all that she had said to him; her words,
      thoughtfully considered, were just those employed by humdrum individuals
      in their commonplace discourses; but, spoken by her, they were a thrill
      with an especial, a significant, importance and beauty. It was inevitable
      that she should have dreamed things immaculate, rare; things like... white
      flowers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shampoo?&rdquo; Bert inquired absent-mindedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>And</i> singed, and curled, and sprinkled with violets,&rdquo; Anthony
      promptly returned. With a flourish, Bert swept aside the muslin folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, in the pursuit of a neglected duty, he crossed the town to a quiet
      corner, occupied by a small dwelling built of smooth, green stone, crowned
      with a fantastic and dingy froth of wood. A shallow, untended garden was
      choked with weeds and bushes, sprawling upward against closely-shuttered
      windows. He had not been to see Mrs. Bosbyshell for two weeks, he
      realized, with a stir of mild self-reproach. He was aware that his visits
      to that solitary and eccentric old woman formed her sole contact with a
      world she regarded with an increasing, unbalanced suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A minute or more after his knock&mdash;the bell handle was missing&mdash;a
      shutter shifted a fraction, upon which he was admitted to a narrow, dark
      hall, and the door bolted sharply behind him. A short, stout woman, in a
      formless wrap of grotesquely gorgeous design, faced him with a quivering,
      apprehensive countenance and prodigiously bright eyes. Her scant,
      yellowish-white hair was gathered aloft in a knot that slipped oddly from
      side to side; and, as she walked, shabby Juliet slippers loudly slapped
      the bare floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want some wood brought in?&rdquo; Anthony inquired; &ldquo;and how does the
      washer I put on the hot water spigot work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little wood, if you please; and the spigot's good as new.&rdquo; She sat on a
      chair, lifting a harassed gaze to his serious solicitation. &ldquo;I've had a
      dreadful time since you were here last&mdash;an evilish-appearing man
      knocked and knocked, at one door and again at another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her voice sank to a shrill whisper, &ldquo;he was after the money.&rdquo; She nodded
      so vigorously that the knot fell in a straggling whisp across her eyes.
      &ldquo;Cousin Alonzo sent him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cousin Alonzo has been dead ten years,&rdquo; he interposed patiently,
      going once more over that familiar ground. &ldquo;Probably it was a man wanting
      to sell gas stoves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know Alonzo,&rdquo; she persisted, unconvinced; &ldquo;I should have to see
      his corp'. He knows I've a comfortable sum put by, and's hard after it for
      his wenching and such practices: small good, or bad, he'll get of it when
      my time comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He passed through the hall to the kitchen, and, unchaining the back door,
      brought a basket of cut wood from a shed, and piled it beside the stove.
      Mrs. Bosbyshell inspected with a critical eye the fastening of the door.
      There was a swollen window sash to release above, a mattress to turn, when
      he was waved ceremoniously into a formal, darkened chamber. The musty
      spice of rose pot-pourri lingered in the flat air; old mahogany&mdash;rush
      bottomed chairs, flute-legged table, a highboy and Dutch clock&mdash;glimmered
      about the walls. A marble topped stand bore orderly volumes in maroon and
      primrose morocco, the top one entitled, &ldquo;The Gentlewoman's Garland. A Gift
      Book.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From a triangular cupboard, she produced a decanter with a carved design
      of bees and cobalt clover, and a plate of crumbling currant cake. &ldquo;A sup
      of dandelion cordial,&rdquo; she announced, &ldquo;a bite of sweet. Growing boys must
      be fed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat, and with patent satisfaction watched Anthony consume the ropy
      syrup and cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met a girl last night,&rdquo; he told her intimately; &ldquo;she had hair like&mdash;like
      a roman candle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you burn your heart up in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me that I was like the early morning,&rdquo; he confided with a rush.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bosbyshell nodded her approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An understandable remark; exactly what I should have said fifty years
      ago; I didn't know the girls of to-day had it in 'em. You've got a good
      heart, Anthony,&rdquo; she enunciated. Anthony shuffled his feet. &ldquo;A good heart
      is a rare thing to find in the young. But I misdoubt, in a world of
      mammon, you'll pay for it dear; I'm afraid you will never be successful,
      so called. It's selling men that that success is got, and buying women,
      and it's never in you to do those. <i>You</i> wouldn't wish an old woman
      gone for the sum she'd laid aside.&rdquo; Her fancies had been wilder than
      usual, he concluded, as the holt of the door at his hack slid home. Alonzo
      and her money, one he considered as actual, as imminent, as the other,
      occupied to the exclusion of all else her dimming brain. He had hoped to
      converse with her more fully on the inexhaustible subject of Eliza Dreen,
      but her vagaries had interrupted him continuously. He decided that she was
      an antiquated bore, but made a mental note to return before the store of
      wood was consumed.

      XI
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the evening he
      stopped from force of habit at Doctor Allhop's drugstore: the familiar
      group was assembled behind the screen at the rear, the conversation flowed
      in the old channels. Anthony lounged and listened, but his attention
      continually wandered&mdash;he heard other, more musical, tones; his vision
      was filled with a candid face and widely-opened eyes in the green gloom of
      a pergola. He passed out by the bevy at the sodawater fountain to the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the artificial day of the electric lights the early summer foliage was
      as virulently green as the toy trees of a miniature ark; the sky was a
      breathless vault filled with blue mists that veiled the stars; under the
      locust trees the blooms were spilled odorously, whitely, on the pavement.
      He walked aimlessly to the outskirts of the town. Across the dim valley,
      against the hills merged into the night and sky, he could see glimmering
      the low lights of Hydrangea House. It would be pleasant, he thought, to be
      closer to that abode of delight; and, crossing the road, he vaulted a
      fence, and descended through a tangle of aromatic grass to the brook that
      threaded the meadow below. A star swam imaged on the black, wrinkled
      surface of the water: it suggested vague, happy images&mdash;Eliza was the
      star, and he was the brook, holding her mirrored in his dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed cows, blowing softly into the sod; a flock of sheep broke before
      him like an argent cloud on the heaven of the fields; and, finally,
      reached the boundary of James Dreen's acres. He forced his way through the
      budding hedge from which the place had its name, and, in a cup of the lawn
      like a pool of brimming, fragrant shadows, sat watching the lights of the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indistinct shapes passed the windows, each&mdash;since it might be she&mdash;carrying
      to him a thrill; indistinguishable voices reached him, the vague tones&mdash;they
      might be hers&mdash;chiming like bells on his straining senses. The world,
      life, was so beautiful that it brought an obstruction into his throat; he
      drew the back of his hand across his eyes, and, to his surprise, found
      that it was wet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, the lights sank on the lower floor and reappeared above. The
      blinding whiteness of the thought of Eliza sleeping seared his brain like
      a flare of powder. When the house retreated unrelieved into the gloom he
      rose and slowly retraced his steps. He lit a cigarette; the match burned
      with a steady flame in the stillness; but, in an unnamed impulse, he flung
      both aside, and filled his lungs with the elysian June air.

      XII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next afternoon,
      returning from the unloading of a grain car at his father's warehouse, he
      discovered a smartly saddled horse fast to the marble hitchingpost before
      his door. It hardly required the glance at the silver &ldquo;D&rdquo; on the headstall
      to inform him who was within. He found Ellie and Eliza Dreen in the corner
      by the Canton tea service, consuming Pekoe and gingerbread dicky birds.
      Eliza nodded and smiled over her shoulder, and resumed an animated
      projection of an excursion in canoes on the Wingohocking. She wore a
      severe coat over white breeches and immaculate boots with diminutive gold
      spurs. Beneath a flat straw hat her hair was confined by a broad ribband
      low upon her neck, while a pink stock was held in position by a
      gaily-checked waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony dropped with affected ease on the sofa, and covertly studied the
      delicate line of her cheek. He now recalled indignantly that Mrs. Dreen
      had said Eliza was not good-looking; while her reference to Eliza's
      veracity had been entirely superfluous. She turned toward him, finally,
      with an engaging query. He saw across her nose a faint trail of the most
      delightful freckles in the world; her eyes were blue, that amazing blue of
      bachelor's buttons; while her mouth&mdash;he would have sworn this the
      first time such simile had been applied to that feature&mdash;was like a
      roseleaf. He made a totally inadequate reply, when Ellie rose, and, plate
      in hand, vanished in quest of a fresh supply of gingerbread. A sort of
      desperate, blundering courage took possession of him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been thinking a lot about you,&rdquo; he told her; &ldquo;last night I sat on
      your grass and wondered which was your window.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a silly I&mdash;we were on the porch all evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't that I wanted to talk to you so much,&rdquo; he tried to explain his
      instinctive impulses, desires, &ldquo;as just to be near you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think,&rdquo; she said slowly, &ldquo;yes, I know&mdash;that is the prettiest thing
      that has ever been said to me. I thought about you... a little; really
      more about myself. I haven't recognized myself at all very lately; I
      suppose it's being home again.&rdquo; She gazed at him candidly, critically.
      &ldquo;You have very unusual eyes,&rdquo; she remarked unexpectedly; &ldquo;they are so
      transparent. Haven't you <i>anything</i> to hide?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some chicken feathers,&rdquo; he affirmed. He grew serious immediately. &ldquo;Your
      eyes are like&mdash;like&mdash;&rdquo; the name of the flower so lately
      suggested by her lucid vision had flown his mind. Suspenders, bachelor's
      suspenders, exclusively occurred to him. &ldquo;An awfully blue flower,&rdquo; he
      temporized.
    </p>
    <p>
      She crossed the room, and bent over the tea roses, freshly placed in the
      jar by the door. &ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; she said, her back to him; &ldquo;I have been here
      a terrific length of time... I thought perhaps you'd come in.... Wasn't it
      shocking of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The knowledge that she had considered the possibility of seeing him filled
      Anthony with incredulous joy. Then, sitting silently, gazing fixedly at
      the floor, he became acutely miserable at the sudden conviction of his
      worthlessness; shame prevented him from looking at her&mdash;surely she
      must see that he, Anthony Ball, the unsuccessful, without prospect, the
      truant from life, was an improper object for her interest. She was so
      absolutely desirable, so fine.
    </p>
    <p>
      He recalled what she had said on the night of the dance... about
      constancy: if the single devotion of his life would mean anything to her,
      he thought grandiloquently, it was hers. He was considering the
      possibility of telling her this when Ellie unnecessarily returned with a
      replenished plate. He was grateful when neither included him in the
      remarks which followed. And he speedily left the room, proceeding to the
      pavement, where he stood with his palm resting on the flank of her horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the slanting rays of the sun the street was a way of gold; when Eliza
      appeared she was ringed in the molten glory. She placed her heel in his
      hand, and sprang lightly into the saddle; the horse shied, there was a
      clatter of hoofs, and she cantered away. Ellie stood on the steps,
      graceful, unconcerned; he watched until the upright, mounted figure was
      out of sight, then silently passed his sister into the house.

    <h2>
      XIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E was in his room
      when the familiar formula of a whistled signal sounded from the darkening
      street. It was Alfred Craik, he recognized the halt ending of the bar; he
      whistled like an old hinge, Anthony thought impatiently. He made his way
      to the lawn, and called shortly, over the crumbling iron fence. Alfred
      Craik was agog with weighty information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The circus is coming in at three-thirty tomorrow morning,&rdquo; he announced.
      &ldquo;The station agent told me... old Giller's lot on Newberry Street. 'Member
      last year we had breakfast with the elephant trainer!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Circuses, Anthony told him in large unconcern, were for infantile minds;
      they might put their circus on top the Courthouse without calling forth
      the slightest notice from him; horses were no better than old cows; and as
      for clowns, the ringmaster, they made him specifically ill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greater part of this diatribe Alfred chose to ignore; he impatiently
      besought Anthony to &ldquo;come off&rdquo;; and warned him strenuously against a tardy
      waking. Once more in his room Anthony smiled at the other's pretty
      enthusiasm. Yet at half past three he woke sharply, starting up on his
      elbow as though he had been called. He heard in the distance the faint,
      shrill whistle of the locomotive drawing the circus into Ellerton. He sank
      back, but, with the face of Eliza radiant against the gloom, slumber
      deserted him. It occurred to him that he might, after all, rise and
      witness from his rarer elevation the preparations that had once aroused in
      him such immature joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circus ground was an apparently inexplicable tangle of canvas and
      lumber, threaded by men like unsubstantial, hurrying shadows. At the fence
      corner loomed the vague bulks of elephants, heaving ceaselessly, stamping
      with the dull clank of chains; a line of cages beyond was still
      indistinguishable. The confusion seemed hopeless&mdash;the hasty,
      desperate labor at the edges of the billowing, grey canvas, the virulent
      curses as feet slipped in the torn sod, the shrill, passionate commands,
      resembled an inferno of ineffectual toil for shades condemned to
      never-ending labor. The tent rose slowly, hardly detached from the thin
      morning gloom, and the hammering of stakes uprose with a sharp, furious
      energy. A wagonload of hay creaked into the lot; a horse whinnied; and,
      from a cage, sounded a longdrawn, despondent howl. The fusillade of
      hammering, the ringing of boards, increased. A harried and indomitable
      voice maintained an insistent grip upon the clamor. It grew lighter;
      pinched features emerged, haggard individuals in haphazard garbs stood
      with the sweat glistening on their blue brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elephants, tearing apart a bale of hay, appeared ancient beyond all
      computation, infinitely patient, infinitely weary. Out of the sudden
      crimson that stained the east a ray of sunlight flashed like a pointed,
      accusing finger and rested on the garish, gilded bars and tarnished fringe
      of the cages; it hit the worn and dingy fur of an aged, gaunt lioness, the
      dim and bleared topaz of her eyes blinking against the flood of day; it
      fell upon a pair of lean wolves trotting in a quick, constricted circle;
      upon a ragged hyena with a dry and uplifted snout; upon a lithe leopard
      with a glittering, green gaze of unquenchable hate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take a hold,&rdquo; a husky voice had urged Anthony; &ldquo;help the circus men put
      up the big tent, and get a free pass.&rdquo; In the contagion of work he had
      pulled upon the hard canvas, the stiff ropes that cut like scored iron,
      and held stakes to be driven into the slushy sod. Thin shoulders strained
      against his own, gasping and maculate breaths assailed him. The flesh was
      tom from a man's palm; another, hit a glancing blow on the head with a
      mall, wandered about dazed, falling over ropes, blundering in paths of
      hasty brutality.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony rested with aching muscles in the orient flood of the sun. The
      tent was erected, flags fluttered gaily aloft, the posters of the sideshow
      flung their startling colors abroad. A musical call floated upward from an
      invisible bugle: an air of gala, of triumphant and irresponsible pleasure,
      permeated the scene. &ldquo;She's all right, isn't she?&rdquo; Alfred Craik demanded
      at his side. He nodded silently, and turned toward home, his pulses
      leaping with joy at the dewy freshness of the morning, the knowledge of
      Eliza&mdash;a sparkling, singing optimism drawn from the unstained
      fountain of his youth.

    <h2>
      XIV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">L</span>ATER, engaged in
      repairing a shelf&mdash;at a super-union scale&mdash;for his mother, he
      heard the steam shriek of a calliope announcing the parade. From a window
      he could see the thronged sidewalks, the crudely fantastic figures of the
      clowns, enveloped in a dusty haze of light. His thoughts withdrew from
      that vapid spectacle to the rapt contemplation of Eliza Dreen. He pictured
      Eliza and himself in the dramatic situations which diversified the moving
      pictures of his nightly attendance: he rescued her from the wiles of
      Mexicans, counts, weirdly-wicked Hindoos; now he dragged her from the
      chimney into which she had been bricked by a Brotherhood of Blood; now,
      driving a monoplane above the hurtling express that bore her toward a
      fiendish revenge, he descended to halt the train at a river's brink while
      the bridge sank dynamited into the swirling stream&mdash;&ldquo;Mercy, Tony!&rdquo;
       his mother's practical voice rent the resplendent vision; &ldquo;don't crush
      your greatuncle's epaulets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the midday meal a minute review of the places where Eliza might be
      found discovered the Ellerton Country Club to hold the greatest
      possibility. Anthony was a virtual stranger to that focus of the newer
      Ellerton; except for the older enthusiasts who played golf every afternoon
      that it was humanly possible to remain outside it was the stronghold of
      the species Anthony had encountered in the dressing room at the Dreens'
      dance. The space at the back of the drugstore where he had lounged held
      unbroken the elder tradition of Ellerton. There he had cultivated a mild
      contempt for the studied urbanity, the formally organized converse and
      games, of the Club. But as a setting for Eliza it gained a compelling
      attraction. And, in his freshly-ironed flannels, he ordered his steps
      toward that goal. The Club House overhung the rolling green of the golf
      links; from a place of vantage he saw that Eliza was not on the veranda;
      at one end a group of young men were drinking&mdash;teal Beyond his father
      and three companions, followed by caddies, rose above a hill. His father
      grasped a club and bent over the turf; the club described a short arc, the
      ball flashed whitely through the air, and the group trotted eagerly
      forward, mingling explanation, chagrin and prediction with heated and
      simple sums in arithmetic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he saw Eliza... she was on the tennis court, playing with a vigorous
      girl with a bare and stalwart forearm. He divined that the latter was
      winning, and conceived a sweeping distaste for her flushed, perspiring
      countenance and thickset ankles. &ldquo;How beautiful you look!&rdquo; Eliza called,
      as he propped himself against the wire netting that, overrun with
      honeysuckle, enclosed the courts. He watched her fleeting form, heard her
      breathless exclamations, with warm stirs of delight. When her opponent
      played the ball beyond her reach his dislike for that efficiency became an
      obsession. The flying shadows lengthened on the rolled, yellow surface of
      the court; the group on the porch emptied their teacups and moved away;
      and the final set of games won by the &ldquo;beefsteak.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eliza slipped into a formless chocolate-colored coat: racket in hand she
      smiled at him. &ldquo;I'm rather done,&rdquo; she admitted. She hesitated, then: &ldquo;I
      wonder&mdash;are you doing anything?&mdash;if you would drive me home?&rdquo; He
      assured her upon that point with a celerity that wrought a momentary
      confusion upon them. &ldquo;The Meadowbrook and roan at the sheds,&rdquo; she
      directed. In the basketlike cart they swung easily over the road toward
      Hydrangea House. Checked relentlessly into a walk the roan stepped in a
      dainty fume.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza's countenance was as tenderly hued as the pearly haze that overlay
      the far hills; faint, mauve shadows deepened the blueness of her eyes; her
      mouth, slightly parted, held the fragile pink of coral; a tinge of
      weariness upon her bore an infinite appeal&mdash;her relaxed, drooping
      body filled him with a gusty longing to put his arms about her shoulders
      and hold her secure against all fatigue, against the assaults of time
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never before driven such an impatient and hasty animal; at the
      slightest slackening of the reins the horse broke into a sharp trot; and,
      beyond doubt, he could walk faster than any other brute alive. Already
      they were at the entrance to the driveway; the house appeared to hurry
      forward to intercept them. Eliza pressed a button, and a man crossed the
      grass to the roan's head. They descended, and she lingered on the steps
      with a murmur of gratitude. &ldquo;Mrs. Dreen telephoned Ranke to meet the
      eight-forty,&rdquo; a servant in the doorway replied to Eliza's query; &ldquo;she's
      having dinner in town with Mr. Dreen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eliza turned with a gesture of appeal. &ldquo;Save me from a solitary pudding,&rdquo;
       she petitioned Anthony; &ldquo;you can go back with Ranke.... On the porch, such
      fun&mdash;father detests candles.&rdquo; The voicing of his acceptance he felt
      to be an absurd formality. &ldquo;Then if you can amuse yourself,&rdquo; she
      announced, &ldquo;I'll vanish for a little... cigars in the library and victrola
      in the hall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the sod to the porch on the other face of the house, and sat
      watching the day fade from the valley below. A violet blur of smoke
      overhung the chimney of the Ellerton Waterworks, printed thinly on the
      sky. A sense of detachment from that familiar scene enveloped him&mdash;the
      base ball field, the defunct garage, places and details, customary,
      normal, retreated into the distance, it seemed into the past, gathering
      upon the horizon of his thoughts as the roofs of Ellerton huddled beyond
      the hills, vanishing into shadows that inexorably deepened, blotted out
      the old aspects, stilled the accustomed voices, sounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A servant appeared, and placed a table upon the tiles, spreading a
      blanched cloth, gleaming crystal and silver. A low bowl of shadowy wood
      violets was ranged in the centre, and hooded candles lighted, spilling
      over the table, the flowers, a pale, auriferous pool of light in the
      purpling dusk. When Eliza followed, in filmy white, she seemed half
      materialized from the haunting vision of poignant beauty at the back of
      his brain. She was like moonlight, still and yet disturbing, veiled in
      illusion, in strange, ethereal influences that set athrill within him
      emotions immaterial, potent, snowy longing, for which he had no name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last plate removed, Anthony stirred his coffee in a state of dreamy
      happiness. The candlelight spread a wan gold veil over Eliza's delicate
      countenance, it slid over the pearls about her slim throat, and fell upon
      her fragile wrists. &ldquo;It's been wonderful,&rdquo; he pronounced solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been terribly rude,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;I have hardly spoken. I have
      been busy studying you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's not much to study,&rdquo; he disclaimed; &ldquo;Mrs. Bosbyshell thinks I'm
      marked for failure.&rdquo; In reply to her demand he gave a brief and diffident
      account of that eccentric old woman. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; Eliza discerned among the
      meagre details, &ldquo;she trusts you, she lets you into her house. And you are
      perfect to her, of course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any one could trust you, I think. Yet you are not a particle tiresome;
      most trustworthy people are so&mdash;so unexciting. But monotony is far as
      possible from your vicinity. What did you do, for instance, this morning?&rdquo;
       He described to her the advent of the circus, the labor in the obscurity.
      &ldquo;I was surprised to see the old thing up,&rdquo; he ended: &ldquo;it seemed so
      hopeless at first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wonderfully poetic!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      Until that moment poetry had occupied in his thoughts a place analogous to
      tea.&mdash;In his brief passage through the last school he had been
      forcibly fed with Gray's Elegy, discovering it unmitigated and sickening
      rot. When now, in view of her obvious pleasure, he would have to
      reconsider his judgment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That blind effort,&rdquo; she continued, leaning forward, flushed with the
      warmth of her image, &ldquo;all those men struggling, building in the dark,
      unable to see what they were accomplishing, or what part the others had.
      And then&mdash;oh! don't you see!&mdash;the great, snowy tent in the
      morning sun&mdash;a figure of the success, the reward, of all labor, all
      living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the ones that loafed&mdash;didn't pull, or were drunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For all,&rdquo; she insisted, &ldquo;sober and drunk and shrinking. Can you think
      that any supreme judgment would be cheaply material, or in need of any of
      our penny abilities? do you suppose the supreme beauty has no standard
      higher than those practical minds that hold out heaven as a sort of reward
      for washed faces? Anthony,&rdquo; it was the first time she had called him that,
      and it rang in his brain in a long peal of rapture, &ldquo;if there isn't a
      heaven for every one, there isn't any at all. You, singing an idle song,
      must be as valuable as the greatest apostle to any supreme love, or else
      it isn't supreme, it isn't love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are so wonderfully good,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;that you think every one else
      is good too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm hardly a bit good,&rdquo; she assured him, &ldquo;and I wouldn't be good if I
      could&mdash;in the Christian kind of way.&rdquo; She gazed about with an
      affectation of secretiveness, then leaned across her coffee cup. &ldquo;It would
      bore me horribly,&rdquo; she confided, &ldquo;that 'other cheek' thing; I'm not a
      grain humble; and I spend a criminal amount of money on my clothes. I have
      even put a patch upon my cheek to be a gin and stumbling-block to a young
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She had!
    </p>
    <p>
      He surveyed with absurd pleasure that minute black crescent on the pale
      rose of her countenance. If she had been good before she was adorable now:
      her confession had drawn her out of the transplendid cloud where he had
      elevated her down to his side; she was infinitely more desirable, more
      warmly and delightfully human.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been asking about you,&rdquo; she told him later, with a slight frown;
      &ldquo;the accounts are, well&mdash;various. I don't mind your&mdash;your
      friends of the stables, Anthony; they are, what Ellerton will never learn,
      the careless choice of a born aristocrat; I don't care a Tecla pearl
      whether you are 'a steady young man' or not. And one doesn't hear a
      whisper of meanness about you anywhere. But I have an exaggerated
      affection for things that are beautiful, I suppose it's a weakness,
      really, and ugly people or surroundings, harsh voices even, terrify me.
      The thought of cruelty makes me cold. And, since you will come into my
      thoughts, and smile your funny little smile at me out of walls and other
      impossible places, I should like to picture you, not in pool rooms, but on
      the hills that you know so well. I should like to think of your mind
      echoing with the rush of those streams, the hunting of those owls, you
      told me about, and not sounding with coarse and silly and brutal words and
      ideas.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It echoes with you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;and you are more beautiful than hills
      and streams.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she held his gaze full in the blue depths of her vision;
      then, with a troubled smile, evaded it. &ldquo;I'm a patched jade,&rdquo; she
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranke, the servant informed them, was ready to meet the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're going... Elbe's affair on the Wingohocking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Absolutely.&rdquo; She stood illusive against the saffron blur of the candles,
      the sweeping hem of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll remember,&rdquo; he blundered; &ldquo;whatever you would wish... you have
      changed everything. The dinner was&mdash;I don't remember what it was,&rdquo; he
      confessed; &ldquo;but I remember an olive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He left the automobile at the edge of Ellerton, and proceeded on foot,
      passing the dully-shinning bulk of the circus tent. He heard the brassy
      dissonance of the band within, the monotonous thud of horses' hoofs on the
      tanbark; a raucous voice rose at the entrance to the side-show dwelling
      unctuously on the monstrosities to be viewed within for the price of a
      dime, of a dime, a dime. He recalled the spent lioness in her painted
      cage, the haggard and sick hyena, the abject trot of the wolves to
      nowhere.&mdash;A sudden exhalation of hatred swept over him for the
      hideous inhumanity of circuses and men. Eliza had lifted him from the
      meaningless babble of trivial and hard voices into a high and immaculate
      region of shining space and quietude. He didn't want to come down again,
      he protested, to <i>this</i>.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NTHONY passed the
      few, intervening days to the excursion on the Wingohocking in a state of
      rapt absorption: his brain sounded with every tone of Eliza's voice; she
      smiled at him, in riding garb, over that delicate trail of freckles; he
      saw her in the misty, amber dress of the dance; in white, illusively lit
      by the candles against the shadowy veranda. Now, for the first time, day
      that had succeeded haphazard to day, without relation or plan, were strung
      together, bound into an intelligible whole, by the thread of romance. He
      must get a firm grip upon reality, construct a solid existence out of the
      unsubstantial elements of his living; but, in his new felicity, he was
      unable to direct his thoughts to details inevitably sordid; he was lost in
      the miracle of Eliza Dreen's mere presence; material considerations might,
      must, be deferred a short while longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      A stainless afternoon sky overspread finally the group gathered about
      covered willow baskets on the green bank of the stream. Behind them the
      meadow swept level, turning back the flood of the sun with a blaze of
      aureate flowers, to a silver band of birch; the upstream reach, wrinkled
      and dark, was lost between tangles of wild grapes; below, with a smooth,
      virid rush, the water poured and broke over rocky shallows.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony launched his canoe from a point of crystalline sand, and, holding
      it against the hank, gazed covertly at Eliza. She was once more in white,
      with a broad apple-green ribband about her waist: she stood above him,
      slenderly poised against the sky; and she was so rare, he thought, so
      ethereal, that she seemed capable of floating off into the blue. Then he
      bent, hastily rearranging a cushion, for she was descending toward him. He
      stepped skilfully after her into the craft, and they drifted silently over
      the surface of the stream. A thrust of the paddle, in a swirl of white
      bubbles, turned them about, and they advanced steadily against the sliding
      current.
    </p>
    <p>
      The still, watery facsimile of the banks were broken into liquid blots of
      emerald and bronze by the bow of the canoe. The air rose coldly from the
      surface to Anthony's face; from the meadows on either hand came the light,
      dry fragrance of newly cut hay; before them trees, meeting above, formed a
      sombrous reach, barred with dusty gold shafts of sunlight that sank into
      the clear depths. He heard behind the distant dip of paddles, and floating
      voices, worlds removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza trailed her hand in the water. An idyllic silence folded them which
      he was loath to break.... He had rolled up his sleeves, and the muscles of
      his forearms swelled rhythmically under the clear, brown skin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are preposterously strong,&rdquo; she approved. His elation, however,
      collapsed at the condition following. &ldquo;But strength is simply brutality
      until it's wisely directed. Mazzini and not Napoleon was my ideal in
      history.&rdquo; Who, he wondered unhappily, was Mazzini? &ldquo;I hated school,&rdquo; he
      told her briefly; &ldquo;I don't believe I have ever read a book through; I'd
      rather paddle about&mdash;with <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you have read deep in the book of nature,&rdquo; she reassured him; &ldquo;only a
      very favorite few open those pages. You are such a child,&rdquo; she added
      obliquely, &ldquo;appallingly unsophisticated: that's what's nicest about you,
      really.&rdquo; That form of laudation left him cold, and he drove the canoe with
      a vicious rush against the reflections. &ldquo;A dear child,&rdquo; she added, without
      materially increasing his pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Words are rot!&rdquo; he exploded suddenly; &ldquo;they can't say any of the
      important things. I could talk a year to you without telling you what I
      feel&mdash;here,&rdquo; he laid a hand momentarily on his spare, powerful chest;
      &ldquo;it's all mixed up, like lead and fire; or that feeling when ice cream
      goes to your head. You see,&rdquo; he ended moodily, &ldquo;all rot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very picturesque... and apparently painful. Words aren't necessary
      for the truly important things, Anthony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you know&mdash;what I think of you; you know... how everything else
      has moved away and left only you; you know a hundred things, all
      important, all about yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She set an uncertain smile against the rush of his words. The stream
      narrowed between high banks drawn against the sheer deeps of sky; the
      water flowed swiftly, with a sustained whisper at the edges, and, for a
      silent space, he paddled vigorously. Then a profound, glassy pool opened,
      sodded bluely to the shores, with low, silvery clumps of willows casting
      sooty shadows across the verd water; and, with a sharp twist, he beached
      the canoe with a soft shock upon the shelving pebbles. As he held the
      craft steady he felt the light, thrilling impact of Eliza's palm as she
      sprang ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The others followed rapidly. The canoes were drawn out of the water, and
      preparations for supper commenced. Eliza and Ellie Ball, accompanied by a
      youth with a pail, proceeded to a nearby farmhouse in quest of milk.
      Anthony lingered at the water's edge, ignoring the appeal for firewood.
      The glow of the westering sun faded from the air, and the reflection of
      the fire lighted behind him danced ruddy op the grass. At intervals small
      fish splashed invisibly, and a kingfisher cried downstream. Then he heard
      his sister's voice, and a familiar and moving perfume hovered in his
      nostrils. He turned and saw Eliza with her arms full of white lilacs. Her
      loveliness left him breathless, mingled with the low sun it blinded him.
      She seemed all made of misty bloom&mdash;a fragrant spirit of ineffable
      flowers. The scent of the lilacs stirred profound, inarticulate emotions
      within him, like the poignant impression left by a forgotten dream of
      shivering delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He scorned the fare soon spread on the clothed sod, burning his throat
      stoically with a cup of unsweetened coffee. Eliza sat beyond the charring
      remains of the fire sinking from cherry-red embers to impalpable white
      ash. He observed with secret satisfaction that she too ate little: an
      appetite on her part, he felt, would have been a calamity.
    </p>
    <p>
      'The meadows and distant woods were vague against the primrose west, the
      cyanite curtain of the east, when the baskets were assembled for the
      return. Anthony delayed over the arrangement of his craft until Eliza and
      himself were last in the floating procession. Dense shadows, drooping from
      the trees, filled the banks; overhead the sky was clear green. They swept
      silently forward with the current, a rare dip of the paddle. Eliza's
      countenance was just palely visible. The lilacs lay in a pallid heap at
      their feet. On either hand the world floated back darkly like an
      immaterial void through which an ebon stream bore them beyond the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a bend he reached up and caught hold of an overhanging branch, and they
      swung into a shallow backwater. A deep shelf of stone lay under the face
      of the bank, closed in by a network of wildgrape stems. &ldquo;This is where I
      sometimes stay at night,&rdquo; he told her; &ldquo;no one knows but you.&rdquo;

      without warning, stepped out upon the rock. &ldquo;Here's where you build your
      fire,&rdquo; she cried at the discovery of a blackened heap of ashes. He secured
      the canoe and followed her. &ldquo;Ideal,&rdquo; she breathed. The sound of the fall
      below was faintly audible; the quavering cry of an owl, the beating of
      heavy wings, rose above the bank. &ldquo;Don't you envy the old pastoral people
      following their flocks from land to land, setting up their tents by
      streams like this, waking with the dawn on the world? or gipsies... you
      must read 'Lavengro.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't envy any one on God's little globe,&rdquo; he asserted; &ldquo;to be here
      with you is the best thing possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something more desirable would soon occur to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than you!&rdquo; he protested; &ldquo;than you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But people get tired of what they have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's what they don't have that makes them old and tired,&rdquo; he told her
      with sudden prescience; &ldquo;when I think of what I am going to lose, of what
      I can never have, it makes me crazy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that?... How can you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was standing close to him in the constricted space, the tangible shock
      of her nearness sweeping over him in waves of heady emotion. The water
      gurgling by the rock was the only sound in a world-stillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm not fairy gold; I'm not the end of the rainbow. I am just
      Eliza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just Eliza!&rdquo; he scoffed. Then the possibility contained in her words
      struck him dumb. The feeling irresistibly returned that because of her
      heavenly ignorance, her charity, she mistook him to be worthy. The
      necessity to guard her from her own divinity impelled him to repeat,
      miserably, all that she had ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not much account,&rdquo; he said laboriously; &ldquo;you see, I never stuck at
      anything, and, somehow, things have never stuck to me. It was that way at
      school&mdash;I was expelled from four. I'm supposed to be shiftless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care in the least for that!&rdquo; she declared; &ldquo;only one thing is
      really important to me... something, oh, so different.&rdquo; Suddenly she laid
      her hand upon his sleeve, and, pitifully white, faced him. &ldquo;I've had the
      beautifullest feeling about you,&rdquo; she whispered; &ldquo;Anthony, tell me truly,
      are you... good?&rdquo; A sob rose uncontrollably in his throat, and his eyes
      filled with tears that spilled over his cheeks. For a moment he struggled
      to check them, then, unashamed, slipped onto his knees before her and held
      her tightly in his arms. &ldquo;No one in the world can say that I am not&mdash;what
      you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stooped, and sat beside him on the stone, holding his hand close to
      her slight body. &ldquo;My dream,&rdquo; she said simply. &ldquo;I didn't understand it at
      first; you see, I was only a child. And then when I grew older, and&mdash;and
      heard things, it seemed impossible. That sort of goodness only bored other
      girls... they liked men of the world, men with a past. I thought perhaps I
      was only morbid, and lost trust in&mdash;in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a kind of accident,&rdquo; he admitted; &ldquo;I never thought about it the
      way you did. It seemed young to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it was an accident in the least,&rdquo; she insisted. A mist
      rose greyly from the darker surface of the stream, and settled cold and
      clammy about Anthony's face. It drew about them in wavering garlands,
      growing steadily denser. Eliza was sitting now pressed against him, and he
      felt a shiver run through her. &ldquo;You are cold!&rdquo; he cried instantly, and
      rose, lifting her to her feet. She smiled, in his arms, and he bent down
      and kissed her. She clung to him with a deep sigh, and met his lips
      steadily with her own. The mist slipped like a veil over Eliza's head and
      drops of moisture shone in her hair. Anthony turned and unfastened the
      canoe; and, suddenly conscious of the length of their delay, he urged it
      with long sweeps over the stream. Beyond the lilacs, distilling their
      potent sweetness in the dark, Eliza was motionless, silent, a flicker of
      white in the gloom.
    </p>
    <p>
      They swept almost immediately into the broad reach where they had started.
      The lights from the windows of a boat house, the voices of the others,
      streamed gaily over the water. He felt Eliza tremble as he lifted her
      ashore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's happiness,&rdquo; she told him; &ldquo;I am ever so warm inside.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>Y his plate at the
      lunch table he discovered, the following day, a small, lavender envelope
      stamped and addressed to Anthony Ball, Esq. He slipped it hastily into his
      pocket, and managed but a short-lived pretext of eating. Then, with the
      letter yet unopened, he left Ellerton, and penetrated into the heart of
      the countryside.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped, finally, under a fence that crossed a hill, on a slope of wild
      strawberries. The hill fell away in an unbroken sweep of undulating,
      blue-green wheat; trees filled the hollow, with a roof and thread of
      silver water drawn through the lush leaves; on either hand chocolate loam
      bore the tender ripple of young com; and beyond, crossed by the shifting
      shadows of slow-drifting clouds, hill and wood and pasture spread a mellow
      mosaic of summer.
    </p>
    <p>
      He tore open the envelope with a reluctant delight. At the top of the
      sheet E D was stamped severely in mauve. &ldquo;My very dear,&rdquo; he read. He
      stopped, suddenly unable to proceed; the countryside swam in his vision;
      he gulped an ecstatic, convulsive breath, and proceeded:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too wonderful&mdash;I can't realize that you exist, and that I have
      found you in such a great world. Isn't it strange how real dreams are;
      just now the real world seems the dream, and my dear home, my mother,
      shadows compared to the thoughts that fill my brain of you, you, you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am writing mostly to tell you something that, perhaps, you didn't
      fully understand yesterday&mdash;and yet I think you must have&mdash;that,
      if you really want me, I am absolutely your own. I couldn't help it if I
      wanted to, and, oh, I don't want to! I let a man at Etretat kiss me, and I
      am glad I did, for it made me understand that I must wait for you.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't write any more now because my head aches. From Eliza who loves
      you utterly.&rdquo; Then he saw that she had written on the following page:
      &ldquo;Don't worry about money and the future; I have my own, all we shall need
      for years, and we can do something together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He laid the letter beside him on the grass. The welling song of a catbird
      sounded unsupportably sweet, and a peaceful column of smoke rose bluely
      from the chimney below: it carried him in imagination to a dwelling set in
      a still, green garden, where birds filled the branches with melody, and
      Eliza and himself walked hand in hand and kissed. Night would gather in
      about their joy, their windows would shine with the golden lamp of their
      seclusion, their voices mingle... sink... sacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dreamed for a long while; the sunlight vanished from the slope below
      him, from the darkling trees, touched only the farthest hills with a rosy
      glow. As the sun sank an errant air whispered in the wheat, and scattered
      the pungent aroma of the wild strawberries. A voice called thinly from the
      swales, and cows gathered indistinctly about a gate. Anthony rose. The
      world was one vast harmony in which he struck the highest, happiest note.
      Beyond the near hills the lilac glitter of the Ellerton lights sprang
      palely up on the blue dusk. As he made his way home, Anthony's brain
      teemed with delightful projects, with anticipation, the thought of the
      house in the hollow&mdash;abode of love, steeped in night.

      wants to see you,&rdquo; she called; &ldquo;at the Club, of course.&rdquo; He wondered
      absently, approaching the Club, what his father wanted. The rooms occupied
      the second story of the edifice that housed the administration of the
      county; the main corridor was choked by a crowd that moved noisily toward
      an auditorium in the rear, but the Club was silent, save for the click of
      invisible billiard balls.

    <p>
      His father was asleep in the reading room, a newspaper spread upon his
      knees, and one thin hand twisted in his beard. Through an open window
      drifted the strains of a band on the Courthouse lawn. The older man woke,
      clearing his throat sharply. &ldquo;Well, Anthony,&rdquo; he nodded. Anthony found a
      chair.

      His father leaned forward, regarding him with a keen, kindly gaze. &ldquo;I'm
      told the garage has gone up,&rdquo; he commenced.

      The other sought his wallet, and, removing a rubber band, counted six
      dollars into Anthony's hand. &ldquo;Meet that in the morning.&rdquo; He leaned hack,
      tapping the wallet with deliberate fingers. &ldquo;I suppose you have no plan
      for the immediate future,&rdquo; he observed.

      &ldquo;Nothing right now.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;I have one for you, though, as 'right now' as this week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony listened respectfully, his thoughts still dwelling upon the beauty
      of the dusk without, of life. &ldquo;You have tried a number of things in the
      past few years without success. I have started you in a small way again
      and again, only to observe the familiar course of a failure inevitable
      from your shiftless habits. You are not a bad boy, but you have no ability
      to concentrate, like a stream spread all over the meadow&mdash;you have no
      course. You're a loiterer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; said Anthony, from the midst of his abstraction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are too old for that now, either it must stop at once, or you will
      become definitely worthless. I am going to make a determined effort&mdash;I
      am going to send you to California, your brother-in-law writes that he can
      give you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The term California sounded in Anthony's brain like the unexpected clash
      of an immense hell. It banished his pleasant revery in disordered shreds,
      filling him with sudden dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I telegraphed Albert yesterday,&rdquo; the even tones continued, &ldquo;and have his
      answer in my pocket. You are to go out to him immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that's impossible,&rdquo; Anthony interrupted; &ldquo;it just can't be done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found himself completely at a loss to give adequate expression to his
      reason for remaining in Ellerton. His joy was so new that he had scarcely
      formulated it to himself, it evaded words, defied definition&mdash;it was
      a thing of dreams, a vision in a shining garment, a fountain of life at
      the bottom of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come; why not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to go away from Ellerton... just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is precisely what you must do. I can understand your desire to
      remain close by your mother&mdash;she has an excuse for you, assistance,
      at every turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't the reason; it's... it's,&rdquo; he boggled horribly, &ldquo;a girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; his father remarked dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony shrunk painfully from the unsympathetic voice of the elder. A new
      defiance of his father welled hotly within him, corrupting the bonds of
      discipline that had held him lovingly to his parent throughout the past. A
      chasm opened between them; and, when Anthony spoke again, it was with a
      voice of insipient insubordination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't the silly stuff you think,&rdquo; he told the other; &ldquo;I'm engaged!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What on?&rdquo; pithily came the inquiry. &ldquo;Unfortunately I can't afford the
      luxury of a daughter-in-law. I thought you were something more of a man
      than to bring your wife into your mother's house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sha'n't; we can get along until I... find work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that your wife will support you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not altogether; she will help until&mdash;until&mdash;&rdquo; he stopped
      miserably before the anger confronting him in the other's gaze: it was
      useless to explain, he thought; But if his father laughed at him, at his
      love, he would leave the room and never see him again. &ldquo;I can't see why
      money is so damned holy!&rdquo; he broke out; &ldquo;why it matters so infernally
      where it comes from; it seems to me only a dirty detail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the measure of a man's honor,&rdquo; the elder Ball told him inexorably;
      &ldquo;how it is made or got stamps you in the world. I am surprised to hear
      that you would even consider taking it from a woman, surprised and hurt.
      It shows all the more clearly the necessity for your going at once into a
      hard, healthy existence. Your mother will get you ready; a couple of days
      should do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... all unexpected,&rdquo; Anthony muttered; &ldquo;I must think about it, see some
      one. I'll&mdash;I'll talk to you to-morrow. That's it,&rdquo; he enunciated more
      hopefully, &ldquo;to-morrow&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Entirely unnecessary,&rdquo; his father interrupted, &ldquo;nothing to be gained by
      delay or further talk. The thing's arranged.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I won't go,&rdquo; Anthony told him slowly. The other picked up the
      paper, smoothing out the creases. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I dare say
      your mother will do something for you.&mdash;Women are the natural source
      of supplies for the sort of person you seem at the point of becoming.&rdquo; A
      barrier of paper, covered with print in regular columns, shut one from the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony burned under a whelming sense of injustice. He decided that he
      would leave the room, his father, forever; but, somehow, he remained
      motionless in his chair, casting about in his thoughts for words with
      which to combat the elder's scorn. He thought of Eliza; she smiled at him
      with appealing loveliness; he felt her letter in his pocket, remembered
      her boundless generosity. He couldn't leave her! The band in the square
      below was playing a familiar operatic lament, and the refrain beat on his
      consciousness in waves of despairing and poignant longing. A sea of misery
      swept over him in which he struggled like a spent swimmer&mdash;Eliza was
      the far, silver shore toward which he fought. It wasn't fair&mdash;a sob
      almost mastered him&mdash;to ask him to go away now, when he had but found
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not Siberia,&rdquo; he heard his father say, &ldquo;nor a life sentence; if this&mdash;this
      'girl' is serious, you will be closer working for her in California than
      idle in Ellerton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't want to go away from her,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;the world's such a hell
      of a big, empty place... things happen.&rdquo; He dashed some bright tears from
      his eyes, and, turning his back on the other, gazed through the window at
      the tops of the maple trees&mdash;a black tracery of foliage against the
      lights below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two or three years should set you on your feet, give you an opportunity
      to return.&rdquo; Eternity could scarcely have seemed more appalling than the
      term casually indicated by his father, it was unthinkable! A club member
      entered, fingering the racked journals on the long table, exchanging
      trivial comments with the older Ball. It seemed incredible to Anthony, in
      the face of the cataclysm which threatened him, that the world should
      continue to revolve callously about such topics. It was an affront to the
      gravity, the dignity, of his suffering. He swiftly left the room.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was Saturday
      night, Bay Street was thronged, the stores brilliantly lit. He saw in the
      distance the red and blue jars of illuminated water that advertised Doctor
      Allhop's drugstore, and turned abruptly on his heel. In the seclusion of
      his room he once more read Eliza's letter: it was a superlative document
      of sweet commonsense, the soul of nobility, of wisdom, of tenderness, of
      divine generosity. In its light all other suggestions, considerations,
      courses, seemed tawdry and ignoble. The boasted wisdom of a world of old
      men, of material experience, seemed only the mean makeshifts for base and
      unworthy ends. The ecstasy sweeping from his heart to his brain, the
      delicious fancies, the rare harmonies, that haunted him, the ineffable
      perfume of invisible lilacs&mdash;these were the true material from which
      to fashion life, these were the high things, the important. And youth was
      the time to grasp them: a swift premonition seized him of the coldness,
      the ineptitude, the disease, of old age.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time in his life he thought of death in definite connection
      with himself: he was turning out the gas, preparatory for sleep; and, at
      the instantaneous darkness, he thought, with a gasp of fear, it would be
      like that. He stood trembling as a full realization of disillusion
      mastered him; all his hot, swinging blood, the instinctive longing for
      perpetuation aroused in him by Eliza, in sick revolt. Fearsome images
      filled his mind... the hole in the clay&mdash;closed; putrefaction; the
      linked mass of worms. In feverish haste he lit the gas; his body was wet
      with sweat; his heart pounding unsteadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The familiar aspect of his room somewhat reassured him; the thought
      dimmed, slowly conquered by the flooding tide of his living. Then he
      realized that Eliza too must die, and his terrors vanished before a loving
      pity for her earthly fragility. Finally, death itself assumed a less
      threatening guise; peace stole imperceptibly into his heart. A vague
      belief, new born of his passion, that dying was not the end of all, rose
      within him&mdash;there must be a struggle, heights to win, gulfs to cross,
      a faith to keep. With steady fingers he turned out the gas.&mdash;Eliza
      was his faith: he fell into a sound slumber.

      when, in the morning, his mother made tentative piles of his clothing. He
      would see Eliza that afternoon, and then announce their decision. His
      mother attempted to fathom his feeling at the prospect of the journey, the
      separation from Ellerton; but, the memory of his father's cutting words
      still rankling in his mind, he evaded her questioning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are going to be miserable out there,&rdquo; she told him, enveloping him
      in the affection of her steady, grey gaze, &ldquo;something else might be found.
      I can always help&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't understand these things,&rdquo; he interrupted her brusquely, annoyed
      by his father's prescience. They were sitting in her sewing room, a pile
      of his socks at her side. She wore her familiar, severe garb, the
      steelbowed spectacles directed upon the needle flashing steadily in her
      assured fingers. She was eternally laboring for her children, Anthony
      realized with a pang of affection. His earliest memories were charged with
      her unflagging care, the touch of her smooth and tireless hands, the
      defense of her energetic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must tell her about his engagement, but not until he had seen Eliza
      again, when something definite would be agreed upon. It was immensely
      difficult for him to talk about the subject nearest his heart-words
      diminished and misrepresented it: he wanted to brood over it, secretly,
      for days.

      with scrupulous exactitude, and proceeded directly to Hydrangea House. The
      afternoon was sultry, the air full of the soothing drone of summer
      insects, the dust of the road rose in heavy puffs about his feet. He
      crossed the stream and fields, saturated with sunlight, and came to the
      pillared portico of his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dreen,&rdquo; Anthony said, stepping forward into the opening door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Dreen cannot see you,&rdquo; the servant returned without hesitation.
      Anthony drew back, momentarily repelled; but, before he could question
      this announcement, he heard grinding wheels on the gravel drive. Turning,
      he saw a motor stop, and Mrs. Dreen descend, followed by a man with a
      somber, deeply-scored countenance. Anthony moved forward eagerly as she
      mounted the steps. &ldquo;Mrs. Dreen,&rdquo; he asked; &ldquo;can you tell me-&rdquo; She passed
      with a confused, blank face, without stopping or acknowledging his
      salutation, and the door closed softly upon her and her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      A momentary flame of anger within Anthony quickly sank to cold
      consternation. Eliza had told her parents and they had dismissed the idea
      and him. It was evident they had forbidden her to see him. He walked
      indecisively down the steps, still carrying his hat, and stopped
      mechanically on the driveway. He gazed blindly over a brilliant, scarlet
      bed of geraniums, over the extended lawn, the rolling hills of Ellerton.
      Then his courage returned, stiffened by the obstacles which apparently
      confronted him: he would show them that he was not to be lightly
      dismissed; no power on earth should separate him from Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant had only obeyed Mrs. Dreen's direction; Eliza, he was certain,
      had no choice in the matter of his reception. Then, unexpectedly, he
      remembered his father's words, the latter's contemptuous reference to all
      appeals to women. He must go to Mr. Dreen, and straightforwardly state his
      position, tell him... <i>what?</i> Why, that he, Anthony Ball, loved
      Eliza, desired her, had come to take her away... <i>where?</i> In all the
      world he had no place prepared for her. He drove his hand into his pocket,
      and discovered a quarter of a dollar and some odd pennies&mdash;all that
      he possessed. Suddenly he laughed, a short, sorry merriment that stopped
      in a dry gasp. He turned and ran, stumbling over the grass, through the
      hot dust, toward Ellerton. Two years, he thought, California; California
      and two years.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NTHONY sat late
      into the night composing an explanatory and farewell letter to Eliza:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your family would laugh at me,&rdquo; he wrote; &ldquo;I couldn't show them a dollar.
      And although my father has done a great deal for me he wouldn't do this. I
      couldn't expect him to. Mother might help, she is like you, but I could
      not very well live between two women, could I? The only hope is California
      for a couple of years. You know how much I want to stay with you, how hard
      this is to write, when our engagement, everything, is so new and
      wonderful. But it would only be harder later. If I had seen you this
      afternoon I would never have left you. I am going to-morrow night. This
      will come to you in the morning, and I will be home if you send me a
      message. I would like to see you again before I go away in order to come
      back to you forever. I would like to hear you say again that you love me.
      Sometimes I think it never really happened. If I don't see you again
      before I leave, remember I shall never change, I shall love you always and
      not forget the least thing you said. I wish now I had studied so that I
      could write better. Remember that I belong to you, when you want me I will
      come to you if it's around the world, I would come to you if I were dead I
      think. Good-bye, dear, dear Eliza, until tomorrow anyhow, and that's a
      long while to be without seeing you or hearing your voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the announcement of his agreement to go West, the attitude of his
      father had changed greatly; his hand continually sought Anthony's
      shoulder; he consulted gravely, as it were with an equal, with regard to
      trains, precautions, new climates. His mother busied herself over his
      clothes, her rare speech brusque and hurried. To Anthony she seemed
      suddenly old, <i>grey</i>; her hands trembled, and necessary stitches were
      uneven.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was aware that the mail for Hydrangea House was collected before noon,
      and he sat expectantly in the room overlooking the street. It was dark and
      cool, there were creamy tea roses in the Canton jar now, while in the
      street it was hot and bright. A sere engraving of Joseph Bonaparte in
      regal robes gazed serenely from the wall. The hour for lunch arrived
      without any message from Eliza. Throughout the afternoon he dropped his
      pressing affairs find descended to the street... nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      His heart grew heavy with doubts, with fears&mdash;his letter had been
      intercepted; or, if Eliza had received it, her answer had been diverted.
      Perhaps she had at last realized that he was unfit for her love. The
      impulse almost mastered him to go once more to Hydrangea House, but pride
      prevented; his unhappiness hardened, grew bitter, suspicious. Then he
      again read her letter, and its patent sincerity swept away all doubt;
      Eliza was unwavering; if not now he would find her at the end of two
      years, unchanged, warm, beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was summoned to dinner, where he found the delicacies he especially
      liked. The plates were liberally filled, all made a pretence at eating,
      but, at the end, the food remained hardly touched. The forced conversation
      fell into sudden, disturbing silences. His father sharpened the carving
      knife twice, which, for shad roe, was scarcely necessary; his mother
      scolded the servant without cause; even Ellie was affected, and smiled at
      him with a bright tenderness.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was to leave Ellerton at midnight, when he would be enabled to connect
      with a western express, and it was arranged for him to spend a last hour
      at the Club with his father. Ellie and the servant stood upon the
      pavement, his mother was upstairs in the sewing room... where he entered
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Club the billiard room was dark, the tables shrouded, but from a
      room at the end of the hall came the murmur of the nightly coon-can
      players. They seated themselves at a table, and his father ordered beer
      and cigars. It was the first time that he had acknowledged Anthony to
      possess the discretion of maturity, and he raised the stein to his lips
      with the feeling that it was a sacrament of his manhood, an earnest and
      pledge of his success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The midnight train emerged from the gloom of the station, passed through
      the outskirts of Ellerton, detached rows of dark dwellings, by the grounds
      of the Baseball Association, its fence still plastered with the gaudy
      circus posters, into the dim fields and shining streams. Anthony stood on
      the last, swinging platform, gazing back at the gloom that enveloped
      Ellerton, at the place where Hydrangea House was hid by the hills. An
      acute misery possessed him&mdash;the unsettled maimer of his departure
      from Eliza, her silence, struggled in his thoughts with the attempt to
      realize the necessity of the course he had adopted to bring about a final
      and lasting joy. He wondered if Eliza would understand the need for his
      going; but, assured of her wise sympathy, he felt that she would; and a
      measure of content settled upon him. The engine swung about a curve,
      disappearing into the obscurity of a wood. &ldquo;Eliza,&rdquo; he cried aloud,
      &ldquo;Eliza, be here when I come back to you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat for the greater part of an hour on the deserted platform of the
      junction, where signal lamps glistened on the steel rails that vanished
      into the night, into the west, the inscrutable future. The headlight of
      the massive locomotive flared unexpectedly, whitely upon him; the engine,
      with a brief glimpse of a sanguinary heart of fire illuminating a sooty
      human countenance, gleaming, liquid eyeballs, passed and stopped; and
      Anthony hastily mounted the train. He made his way through the narrow
      passage of buttoned, red curtains, and found his berth, when he sank into
      a weary, dreamless sleep.

      was the last berth made up for the day; the car, shaded against the sun,
      was rolling slightly, and he braced himself as he made his way toward
      breakfast. The tables were all occupied; but, at a carelessly hospitable
      nod, he found a place with two men. They were, he immediately saw, Jews.
      One was robustly middle aged, with a pinkly smooth countenance, a slightly
      flattened nose, and eyes as colorless as clear water in a goblet. He was
      carefully dressed in shepherd's plaid, with a gay tie that held a
      noticeably fine pearl. His companion was thin and dark, with a heavy nose
      irritated to rawness by the constant application of a blue silk
      handkerchief. The latter, Anthony discovered in the course of the
      commonplaces which followed, was sycophant and henchman of the first&mdash;a
      never failing source of applause for the former's witticisms.

    <p>
      &ldquo;How far out are you bound?&rdquo; queried the owner of the pearl. Then, when
      Anthony had told him his destination, &ldquo;no business opportunities in
      California for a young man without capital behind him; only hard work and
      a day laborer's wages. Nothing West but fruit, land and politics on a
      large scale. My chauffeur at a hundred a month does better than eighty per
      cent, of the young ones in the West.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This information fell like a dark cloud over Anthony's sanguine hopes for
      a speedy and opulent return. A sense of imminent misfortune pressed upon
      him, a sudden, unreasoning dread of what might be in store for Eliza and
      himself, of the countless perils of a protracted delay. At the end of two
      years he might be no better off than he was at present. His
      brother-in-law, he knew, would only pay him a nominal amount at first. The
      two years stretched out interminably in his imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The more prosperous of his companions selected a cigar from a silk case,
      and, cutting it with a gold penknife, they removed to the smoking car. &ldquo;I
      drove a car for a while,&rdquo; Anthony informed them later, mingling the
      acidulous smoke of a Dulcina with the more fragrant clouds of Habana; &ldquo;it
      was a Challenger six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hartmann here is a director in the Challenger factory,&rdquo; the sycophant
      told him. &ldquo;The factory's in our home city, where we are going. It's a
      great car.&rdquo; Hartmann examined Anthony with a new and more personal
      interest. &ldquo;Did you like it?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, for the price,&rdquo; Anthony assured him; &ldquo;it's the most
      sporting looking car on the American market.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the thing,&rdquo; the other declared with satisfaction; &ldquo;big sales and a
      quick return on investment. A showy car is what the public want, the
      engine's unimportant, it's paint that counts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you have any radiator trouble?&rdquo; Anthony demanded. The other regarded
      him shrewdly. &ldquo;I run a Berliet,&rdquo; he announced; &ldquo;I was discussing a popular
      article.&rdquo; He arranged himself more comfortably in his leather chair, and
      prepared for sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony returned to his place in the coach, where he brooded dejectedly
      upon what he had heard about California. He thought of the distance
      widening at a dizzy rate between Eliza and himself, and plunged into a
      vast pit of loneliness... he had made a terrible mistake in leaving her.
      It seemed to him now that he had deserted her, perhaps she was suffering
      on account of him&mdash;had expected him to free her from an intolerable
      condition. Again he cursed in his heart the prudent counsel of old men,
      the cold sapience of the world, that had betrayed him, that had prevailed
      over him against his instinct, his longing.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T lunch he was
      progressing toward an empty table when Hartmann waved him imperiously to a
      place at his side. &ldquo;Have a drink,&rdquo; he advised genially; &ldquo;this is my
      affair.&rdquo; Beer followed the initial cocktail, and brandy wound the meal to
      a comfortable conclusion. A Habana in the smoking car completed Anthony's
      bodily satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;California's no place for a young man without capital,&rdquo; Hartmann
      reiterated; &ldquo;you work like a dog for two and a half a day; no future.&rdquo; He
      paused, allowing this to be digested, then: &ldquo;I have a little plan to
      propose, you can take it or not&mdash;or perhaps you are not competent.&mdash;My
      chauffeur is laid up with a broken wrist, a matter of a month or more; how
      would you like to run my car until he returns? Then, if you are
      satisfactory, you can go into the Challenger factory, with something ahead
      of you, a future. Or you can go on to California... say seventy-five
      dollars richer.&rdquo; Anthony shook his head regretfully. &ldquo;Don't answer now,&rdquo;
       Hartmann advised; &ldquo;Spring City is three hours off. Think it over;
      seventy-five dollars; a chance, if you are handy, in the factory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony was suddenly obsessed by the thought that, at Spring City, he
      would be only a day removed from Eliza. He wondered what his father would
      say to this new possibility? At worst he would only be delayed in his
      arrival in California, and with seventy-five dollars in consequence. At
      best&mdash;the Challenger factory: he expanded optimistically the
      opportunities offered by the latter. If he could show his father immediate
      fruits from a change of plan, the elder, he was certain, would add his
      approval. In a passing, sceptical mood he speculated upon Hartmann's
      motive in this offer to an entire stranger; but his doubts speedily
      vanished&mdash;any irregularity must be immediately visible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can make a stop over on your ticket for a couple of days and try it,&rdquo;
       the other interjected; &ldquo;it will cost you nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Only a day removed from Eliza! he would write to his father, his
      brother-in-law, and explain! he had decided that it would do no harm to
      try it. &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; the Jew exclaimed; &ldquo;see the conductor about your ticket.
      If you decide to remain you can send for your trunk.&rdquo; He offered his cigar
      case to his companion, but, now, neglected to include Anthony.
      Imperceptibly their relations had changed; Hartmann's geniality decreased;
      his colorless gaze wandered indifferently. Anthony found the conductor,
      and arranged a stop-over at Spring City. He collected his belongings; and,
      not long after, he stood on a station platform beside his bag, watching
      with sudden misgivings the rear of the train he had left disappearing
      behind a bulk of factories and clustered shanties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartmann handed him a card, with a written direction and address. &ldquo;The
      garage,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;have the car ready to-morrow at nine. I'll allow
      you an expense of five dollars until a definite arrangement.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony quickly found the garage&mdash;a structure of iron and glass, with
      a concrete floor where cars were drawn up in glistening rows. A line of
      chairs fronted upon the pavement, occupied by mechanics in greasy
      overalls, smarter chauffeurs, and garrulous, nondescript hangerson. The
      foreman was within, busy with the compression tanks. He was short in
      stature, with a pale, concerned countenance. &ldquo;Fourth on the right from the
      front,&rdquo; he directed, reading Hartmann's card; &ldquo;there's a bad shoe on the
      back.... So the old man's ready for another little trip,&rdquo; he commented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His chauffeur has a broken wrist,&rdquo; Anthony explained. &ldquo;He's offered me
      the job for a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrist hell! Hartmann fired him, he knew too much&mdash;about sprees with
      Kuhn. He's a sharp duck; I'll bet he picked you up outside Spring City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met him on the Sunset Limited,&rdquo; Anthony continued; &ldquo;I understood he was
      a director in the Challenger Motorcar Company&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's that, right enough; the rottenest car and shop in America; they're
      so dam' mean they won't provide their men with drinking water; they have
      to bring labor from the East, scabs and other truck.&rdquo; The conviction
      settled heavily upon Anthony that, after all, he had made a mistake in
      listening to Hartmann, in falling in with his suggestion. If there had
      been another train through Spring City that night for California he would
      have taken it. But, as there was not, and he had committed himself for the
      next twenty-four hours, he made his way to the Berliet car indicated.
      There he took off his coat, and busied himself with replacing the damaged
      shoe. When that was accomplished the dusk had thickened to evening, the
      suspended gas globes in the garage had been lighted, and shone like
      lemon-yellow moons multiplied in the lilac depths of a mirrored twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw, across the street, a creamery, and, at a bare table, consumed a
      quart of milk and a plate of sugared rusk. Then, on a chair in the line
      before the garage, he sat half intent upon the conversation about him,
      half considering the swift changes that had overtaken him in the past, few
      days. His fingers closed upon Eliza's letter in his pocket, and he gazed
      at the callous and ribald faces at his side, he heard the truculent
      laughter, with wonderment that they existed in the same world with her
      delicate beauty. She smiled at him, out of his memory, over a mass of
      white bloom, and the present seemed like an ugly dream from which he must
      awake in her presence. Or was the other a dream, a vision of immaterial
      delight spread before his wondering mind, and this harsh mirth, these
      mocking faces, Hartmann's smooth lies, the hateful reality?
    </p>
    <p>
      The night deepened, one by one the chairs before the garage were deserted,
      the sharp pounding of a hammer on metal sounded from within, the
      disjointed measures of a sentimental song. A sudden weariness swept over
      Anthony, a distaste for the task of seeking a room through the strange
      streets; and, arranging the cushions in Hartmann's car, he slept there
      until morning. He awoke to the flooding of the concrete floor with a sheet
      of water flashing in the crisp sunlight. It was eight o'clock, and he made
      a hurried toilet at a convenient spigot, breakfasting at the creamery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartmann appeared shortly after nine: his countenance glowed from a
      scented massage, his yellow boots shone with restrained splendor, and a
      sprig of geranium was drawn through an ironed buttonhole. He nodded
      briefly to Anthony, and narrowly watched the latter manouvre the Berliet
      from its place in the row onto the street. They sped smoothly across town
      to what, evidently, was the principal shopping thoroughfare; and, before a
      glittering plateglass window that bore the chaste design, &ldquo;Hartmann &amp;
      Company&rdquo; drew up, and Hartmann prepared to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'll go on West,&rdquo; Anthony informed him; &ldquo;this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annoyance was plainly visible upon the other's countenance. &ldquo;I was just
      congratulating myself on a find,&rdquo; he declared; &ldquo;you must at least stay
      with me until I get some one else.&rdquo; He paused; Anthony made no comment.
      &ldquo;Now, listen to what I will do,&rdquo; he pronounced finally; &ldquo;if you will stay
      with me for a month I'll give you a hundred dollars and your expenses&mdash;it
      will be clear money. I... I had thought of taking a little trip in the
      car, I'm feeling the store a little, and I need a discreet man. Think it
      over&mdash;a hundred in your pocket, and you may be able to get off in
      three weeks.&rdquo; He left hurriedly, without giving Anthony an opportunity for
      further speech. It was an alluring offer, a hundred dollars secured for
      the future, for Eliza. He speculated about the prospective trip,
      Hartmann's wish to secure a &ldquo;discreet&rdquo; man, the foreman's insinuations.
      However, the motive didn't concern him, the wage was his sole
      consideration, and that, he decided, he could not afford to lose. He
      whistled to a newsboy, and, studying the baseball scores, waited
      comfortably for his employer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later he drove Hartmann, now accompanied by Kuhn, out of town, through a
      district of suburban villas, smooth, white roads and green lawns, into the
      farmland and pasturage beyond. They finally stopped at an inn of weathered
      grey stone set behind a row of ancient elms. A woman was sitting on the
      portico, and she rose and came forward sinuously as the men descended from
      the motor car. Anthony saw that she had a full, voluptuous figure,
      lustreless, yellow hair, and sleepy eyes. Hartmann patted her upon the
      shoulder, and the three moved to the portico, where they sat conversing
      over a table of whiskies and soda. Occasional shrill bursts of laughter,
      gross terms, reached Anthony. The woman lounged nonchalantly in her chair;
      she wore a transparent white waist, through winch was visible a confused
      tracery of purple ribband, frank rubicund flesh. When the men rose,
      Hartmann kissed her. &ldquo;Thursday,&rdquo; he reminded her; &ldquo;shortly after three.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I'll depend on you,&rdquo; Kuhn added,&mdash;&ldquo;a good figger and a loving
      disposition. We don't want any dead ones on this trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Laura's all right,&rdquo; she assured him; &ldquo;she's just ready for something of
      this sort; she goes off about twice a year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had started, Hartmann leaned forward. &ldquo;Going Thursday... that
      little trip I spoke to you about.&mdash;No talking, understand. Look over
      the tires, get what you think-necessary for five or six hundred miles.&rdquo; He
      tended Anthony a crisp, currency note. &ldquo;Here's the five. Your salary
      starts to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That night Anthony wrote a letter of explanation to his father, a note to
      California in reference to his trunk, and a short communication to Eliza.&mdash;He
      was not certain that she would receive it. Her parents, he was convinced,
      were opposed to him&mdash;they were ignorant of the singleness, the depth,
      the determination, of his love.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T. was nearly
      four, when, on Thursday, Anthony stopped the car before the inn by the
      elms. The woman with the yellow hair, accompanied by a figure in a
      shapeless russet silk coat, were waiting for them. The latter carried a
      small, patent-leather dressing case, and a large bag reposed on the
      portico, which Anthony strapped to the luggage rack. Kuhn, animated by a
      flow of superabundant animal spirits, bantered each member of the party:
      he gave Anthony a cigar that had been slightly broken, tipped off
      Hartmann's cap, and assisted the woman with profound gallantry into the
      car. Hartmann discussed routes over an unfolded map with Anthony; then,
      the course laid out, they moved forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their way led over an old postroad, now between walls, trees, dank and
      grey with age and dust, now rising steadily into a region of bluish hills.
      Scraps of conversation fell upon Anthony's hearing: the woman in the
      russet coat, he learned, was named Laura Dallam. Kuhn talked incessantly,
      and, occasionally, she replied to his sallies in a cool, detached voice.
      She differed in manner from the others, she was a little disdainful,
      Anthony discovered. Once she said sharply, &ldquo;Do let me enjoy the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They slipped smoothly through the afternoon to the end of day. The sun had
      vanished beyond the hills when they stopped at an inn on the outskirts of
      an undiscovered town. It was directly on the road, and, built in a flimsy
      imitation of an Elizabethan hostelry, had benches at either side of the
      entrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      There Anthony sat later, while, from a balcony above him, fell the tones
      of his employer and his companions. He could hear them clearly,
      distinguish Hartmann's heavy jocularity, the yellow-haired woman's syrupy
      voice, Laura Dallam's crisp utterances. Kuhn's labored wit had drooped
      with the afternoon, an accent of complaint had grown upon him.
      Occasionally there was a thin, clear tinkle of glasses and ice. As the
      night deepened, the conversation above grew blurred, peals of
      inconsequential laughter more frequent; a glass fell on the balcony, and
      broke with a small, sudden explosion. Some one&mdash;it was the Dallam
      woman, exclaimed, &ldquo;don't!&rdquo; She leaned over the railing above Anthony's
      head, and said despairingly, &ldquo;I can't get drunk!&rdquo; Kuhn pressed to her
      side, and she moved away impatiently. He became enraged, and they
      commenced a low, bitter wrangling. Finally Hartmann insinuated himself
      between them; the two women disappeared; and Kuhn complained aloud of the
      manner in which he had been treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's all right,&rdquo; Hartmann assured him; &ldquo;you went at it too heavy; take
      your time; she's not a flapper from the chorus.&rdquo; They tramped heavily
      across the balcony, whispering tensely, into the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning following they failed to start until past eleven: Hartmann's
      countenance was pasty from the night's debauch, greenish shadows hung
      beneath his colorless eyes, his mouth was a leaden line; the yellow-haired
      woman was haggard, she looked older by ten years since the day previous.
      Kuhn was savagely, morosely, silent. But Mrs. Dallam was as fresh, as
      sparkling, as the morning itself. She nodded brightly at Anthony as she
      took a seat forward, by his side. A heavy veil was draped back from her
      face, and he saw that it was finely-cut; an intensely black bang fell
      squarely across her low, white forehead, beneath which eyes of a sombre,
      velvety blue were oddly compelling; and against the blanched oval of her
      face her mouth was like a print of blood. It was a potent, vaguely
      disturbing countenance; and, beneath the voluminous silk coat, he saw
      narrow black slippers with carelessly tied bows that, stinging his
      imagination, reminded him of wasps.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he drove the car he was frequently aware of her exotic gaze resting
      speculatively upon him. On a high, sunny reach of road there was a shrill
      rush of escaping air, and he found a rear tire flat. Hartmann and his mate
      explored the road, Kuhn gloomed aloof, while Mrs. Dallam seated herself on
      a nearby bank, as Anthony replaced the inner tube. It was hot, and he
      removed his coat, and soon his shirt was clinging to the rippling, young
      muscles of his vigorous torso. Once, when he straightened up to wipe the
      perspiration from his brow, Mrs. Dallam caught his glance, and held it
      with a slow smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their progress for the day ended at a small hotel maintained upon the roof
      of a ridge of hills. As the dusk deepened the valley beyond swam with
      warm, scattered lights, while above, in illimitable space, gleamed stars
      near, only a few millions of miles away, and stars far, millions upon
      millions of miles distant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground floor of the hotel was divided by a passage, on one side the
      bar, and the other a dining and lounging room, lit with kerosene lamps
      swung below tin reflectors. When Anthony was ready for supper the others
      had disappeared above. He was served by the proprietor, a short, rotund
      man with a glistening red face and hands like swollen pincushions. He
      breathed stentoriously amid his exertions, muttering objurgations in
      connection with the name of an absent servitor, hopelessly drunk, Anthony
      gathered, in the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bell sounded sharply from above, and he disappeared abruptly, shouting
      up the stair. Then, shortly after, he reappeared in the dining room with a
      tray bearing a pitcher of water, glasses, and a bottle labelled with the
      name of a popular brand of whiskey. &ldquo;Can you run this up to your folks?&rdquo;
       he demanded, in a storm of explosive breaths; &ldquo;I got enough to stall three
      men down here.&rdquo; Anthony balanced the tray, and moved toward the stair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stopped in the hallway to redispose his burden, when he heard the
      changing gears of a second automobile without. He moved carefully upward,
      conscious of lowered voices at his back, then the sound of footsteps
      following him. He turned as he had been directed in the hall above, and
      knocked upon a closed door. Kuhn's sullen voice bade him enter. He had
      opened the door, when, almost upsetting the tray, a small group at his
      back pushed him aside, and entered Hartmann's room.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE flaring gas jet
      within shone on Hartmann, in his shirt sleeves, reclining collarless on a
      bed, while the yellow-haired woman, in a short, vividly green petticoat,
      but otherwise normally garbed, sat by him twisting her fingers in his
      hair. Mrs. Dallam, her waist open at the neck, was cold-creaming her
      throat, while Kuhn was decorating her bared arms with pats of pink powder
      from a silver-mounted puff. He turned at the small commotion in the
      doorway.... His jaw dropped, and his glabrous eyes bulged in incredulous
      dismay. The powder puff fell to the floor; he wet his dry lips with his
      tongue. &ldquo;Minna!&rdquo; he stammered; &ldquo;Minna!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman in the door had grey hair streaked and soiled with sallow white,
      and a deeply scored, harsh countenance. Her gnarled hands were tightly
      clenched, and her tall, spare figure shook from suppressed excitement and
      emotion. At her back were two men, one unobtrusive, remarkable in his lack
      of salient feature; the other stolidly, heavily, Semitic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hartmann hastily scrambled into an upright position; the woman at his side
      gave vent to a startled, slight scream, desperately arranging her scant
      draperies; Mrs. Dallam, with a stony face, continued to rub cold-cream
      into her throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mrs. Kuhn,&rdquo; Hartmann stuttered, &ldquo;everything can he satisfactorily
      explained.&rdquo; The woman he addressed paid not the slightest attention to
      him, but, advancing into the room, gazed with mingled hatred and curiosity
      at Mrs. Dallam. The two women stood motionless, tense, oblivious to the
      others, in their silent, merciless battle. The latter smiled slightly,
      with coldly-contemptuous lips, at the grotesque figure, the ill-fitting
      dress upon the wasted body, the hat pinned askew on the thin, time-stained
      hair, before her. And the other, painfully rigid, worn, brittle, gazed
      with bitter appraisal at the softly-rounded, graceful figure, the mature
      youth, that mocked her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minna,&rdquo; Kuhn reiterated, &ldquo;come outside, won't you, I want to see you
      outside. Tell her to go out, Abbie,&rdquo; he entreated the stolid figure at the
      door; &ldquo;it ain't fit for her to be here. I will see you all down stairs.&rdquo;
       He laid a shaking hand upon his wife's shoulder. &ldquo;Come away,&rdquo; he implored.
    </p>
    <p>
      But still, unconscious apparently of his presence, she gazed at Mrs.
      Dallam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gutter piece!&rdquo; she said finally; &ldquo;you thief!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dallam laughed easily. &ldquo;Steal that!&rdquo; she exclaimed, indicating Kuhn,
      &ldquo;that... beetle! If it's any consolation to you&mdash;he hasn't put his
      hand on me. It makes me ill to be near him. I should be grateful if you'd
      take him home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so, Mrs. Kuhn,&rdquo; Hartmann interpolated eagerly, &ldquo;nothing's went on
      you couldn't witness, nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tears stole slowly over the inequalities of Mrs. Kuhn's countenance. She
      trembled so violently that the man called Abbie stepped forward and
      supported her. Now tears streamed copiously over Kuhn's narrow
      countenance. &ldquo;Oh, Minna!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;<i>can</i> I go home with you? can I
      go <i>now?</i> These people don't mean anything to me, not like you do.&mdash;I
      get crazy at times, and gotta have excitement; I hate it,&rdquo; he declared;
      &ldquo;but I can't somehow stand out against it. But you must give me another
      try.... Why, I'd be nothing in the world without you; I'd go down to hell
      alive without you, Minna.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Kuhn became unmanageable; she uttered a series of short, gasping
      cries, and wilted into the arm about her. &ldquo;Take her out, Abbie,&rdquo; Kuhn
      entreated, &ldquo;take her out of this.&rdquo; Anthony, with the tray still balanced
      in his grasp, stood aside. The man without characteristics was making
      rapid notes in an unostentatious wallet. Then Mrs. Kuhn, supported and
      followed by her husband and the third, disappeared into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut the door,&rdquo; Hartmann commanded sharply; &ldquo;and give me a drink.&rdquo;
       Anthony set the tray on a table. &ldquo;God!&rdquo; the yellow-haired woman
      ejaculated, &ldquo;me too.&rdquo; Mrs. Dallam returned to the mirror, and surveyed the
      effects of the cold cream. With an expression of distaste she brushed the
      marks of the powder from her arm. &ldquo;The beetle!&rdquo; she repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Minna Kuhn won't bring action,&rdquo; Hartmann declared, with growing
      confidence; &ldquo;she'll take him back; nothing will come out.&rdquo; The other woman
      drank deeply, a purplish flush mantelled her full countenance. A strand of
      metallic hair slipped over her eyes. &ldquo;Let her talk,&rdquo; she asseverated;
      &ldquo;we're bohemians.&rdquo; She clasped Hartmann to her ample bosom.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Dallam moved to the half opened door to the room beyond. &ldquo;Bring in
      the pitcher of water, Anthony,&rdquo; she directed. He followed her with the
      water, and she bolted the door behind them. The door to the hall was
      closed too. She stopped and smiled at him with narrowed, enigmatic eyes.
      The subtle force of her being swept tingling over him. She laid her hand,
      warm, palpitatingly alive, upon his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The swine,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;how did we get into this, you and I?&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE patent-leather
      dressing case lay open on a bureau, spilling a small cascade of ivory
      toilet implements, a severely-plain black dinner gown lay limp, dully
      shimmering, over the back of a chair, and, on the bed, a soft, white heap
      of undergarments gave out a seductive odor of lavender. &ldquo;Cigarettes in the
      leather box,&rdquo; she indicated; &ldquo;take some outside.&rdquo; A screened door opened
      upon a boxlike balcony, cut into the angle of the roof; and Anthony,
      conscious of the warm weight of a guiding arm, found himself upon it. He
      seated himself on the railing, and lit a cigarette. He must go in a
      minute, he thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lights had vanished from the valley, at his back the risen moon dimmed
      the stars, turned the leaves silver grey. A wan ray fell upon a clump of
      bushes below&mdash;lilacs, but the blooms had wilted, gone. The screen
      door opened, and Mrs. Dallam was at his side; she sank into a chair, the
      rosy blur of a cigarette in her fingers; she wore a loose wrap of deep
      green silk, open at her throat upon the white web beneath; in the
      obscurity her eyes were as black, as lustreless, as ebony, her mouth was a
      purple stain.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smoked silently, gazing into the night. He would go now, he decided,
      and moved from his place on the rail. But with clinging fingers she caught
      his wrist, reproachfully lifting a velvety gaze. &ldquo;I will not be left
      alone,&rdquo; she declared; &ldquo;I simply must have some one with me... you, or I
      will get despondent. You are&mdash;no, I won't say young, that would make
      you cross; you are like that fabulous fountain the Spaniards hunted in
      Florida, I want to drink deep, deep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony's resolution wavered; it was early; it pleased him that so fine a
      creature should desire his presence; an unhappy note in her voice moved
      him to pity. She was lonely, and he was alone&mdash;here; why should they
      not support each other? He leaned, close to her, upon the sloping roof.
      She talked little; she laughed once, a low, silvery peal whose echo ran up
      and down his spine.
    </p>
    <p>
      They heard a servant closing the shutters, the doors, below them, and the
      sound linked Anthony to Mrs. Dallam in a feeling of pervading intimacy.
      She rose, and stood pressed against his side, and his heart beat instantly
      unsteady. The night grew strangely oppressive, there was a roll of
      distant, muffled thunder; he turned to her with a commonplace about the
      heat, when her arms went about his neck, and she kissed him full, slowly,
      upon the lips. Unconsciously he held her supple body to him. She leaned
      back against his arms, her eyes shut and lips parted. A terrible and brute
      tyranny of desire welled up within him, sweeping away every vestige of
      control, of memory. The sky whirled in his vision, the substantial world
      vanished in a smother of flaming mists.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then he released her so suddenly that she fell against the rail,
      recovering her poise with difficulty. Anthony stumbled back, drawing his
      hand across his brow. &ldquo;What... what damned perfume's on you?&rdquo; he demanded
      hoarsely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None at all,&rdquo; she assured him, &ldquo;I never... Why, Anthony, are you ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wave after wave of sweetness enveloped him, choking, nauseating, stinging
      his eyes, extinguishing the fire within him, turning the lust to ashes. He
      too supported himself upon the rail, and his gaze fell below, to the
      bushes. Was it the moonlight, or were they, where they had been bare a few
      minutes before, now covered with great misty masses of lilacs?
    </p>
    <p>
      The perfume of the flowers came up to him breath on breath: he could see
      them clearly now.... White lilacs! An overwhelming panic swept over him, a
      sudden dread of his surrounding, of the silken figure of the woman before
      him. He must get away. He pushed her roughly aside, swung back the screen
      door, and clattered through the room and down the stair. He fumbled for a
      moment with a bolted door, and then was outside, free. Without hesitancy
      he fled into the night, the secretive shadows. He ran until he literally
      fell, with bursting lungs and shaking, powerless knees, upon a bank.

      XXVIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE hotel was lost;
      the silence, the peace of nature, unbroken. A drowsy flutter of wings
      stilled in a hedge. The moon sailed behind a cloud that drooped low upon
      the earth, and great, slow drops of rain fell to a continuous and far
      reverberation. They struck coolly upon Anthony's face, pattered among the
      grass, dropped with minute explosions of dust upon the road. The shower
      passed, the cloud dissolved, and the crystal flood of light fell once more
      into the cup of the valley.
    </p>
    <p>
      It spread like a balm over Anthony: Hartmann, Mrs. Dallam, the weeping
      face of Mrs. Kuhn, were like painted figures in a distasteful act upon
      which he had turned his back, from which he had gone forth into the
      supreme spectacle of the spheres, the presence of Eliza Dreen. Every atom
      thrilled with the thought of her. &ldquo;Oh, my very dear,&rdquo; he whispered to the
      sleeping birds, the dead, white disk of the moon: &ldquo;I will come back to
      you... good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the rain the night was like a damp, sweet veil upon his face; the
      few stars above him were blurred as though seen through tears; the horizon
      burned in a circle of flickering, ruddy light. He took up his way once
      more over the soft folds of the road; now, accustomed to the dark, he
      could distinguish the smooth pebbles by the way, separate, grey blades of
      grass. He walked buoyantly, tirelessly, weaving on the loom of the dim
      miles mingled visions of future and past, dominated by the serene presence
      of Eliza.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt in a pocket the wallet containing his ticket to California and the
      generous sum added by his father. There must be no more delay in arriving
      at his western destination! His excursion with Hartmann had been a grave
      error; he saw it clearly now, one of those faults&mdash;so fatally easy
      for him to commit&mdash;which, if his life was to spell success, if he was
      to come finally into his heritage of joy, he must scrupulously avoid. In
      the future he would drive directly, safely, toward his goal; he would
      become part of that orderly pattern of life plotted in streets and staid
      occupations: at the end of day he would return to his small,
      carefully-tended garden to weed and water, and sit with Eliza on his
      portico&mdash;a respectable, an authentic, member of society. On Sunday
      morning they would go to the Episcopal Church, they would join the sober,
      festivally-garbed procession moving toward the faint thunder of the organ.
      And, at dinner, he would carve the roast. Thus, quietly, they would grow
      old, grey, together. They would have a number of children&mdash;all girls,
      he decided.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imperceptibly the morning was born about him, faint shadows grew under the
      hedges, the sweet, querulous note of a robin sounded from the sparkling
      sod. A wind stirred, as immaculate, as dewly fresh, as though it were the
      first breath blown upon a new world of virginal and lyric beauty. The
      molten gold of the sun welled out of the east and spilled over the wooded
      hills and meadows; the violet mists drawn over the swales and streams
      dissolved; Anthony met a boy driving cows to pasture.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E rapidly overtook
      a bent and doggedly tramping figure; no common wanderer, he recognized, as
      he drew nearer. The others decent suit was eminently presentable, his felt
      hat brushed, his shoes comparatively new. He turned upon Anthony a
      countenance as expressionless, as darkly-stained, as a chipped and rusted
      effigy of iron; deep lines fell back across the dingy cheeks; his lipless
      mouth was, apparently, another such line; and his eyes, deeply sunk in the
      skull, were the eyes of a dead man. Yet they were not blind; they saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      He halted, and surveyed Anthony with a lowered, searching curiosity,
      clenching with a strained and surprising force the knob of a black stick.
      Anthony met his scrutiny with the salutation of youth and the road; but
      the other made no reply; his countenance was as blank as though no word
      had been spoken. Then a sudden flicker of hot light burned in the dull
      depths of his gaze, his worn face quivered with a swift malignancy, an
      energy of suspicion, of hatred, that touched Anthony's heart with a cold
      finger of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's your name?&rdquo; he demanded, his entire being strained in an agony of
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony informed him with scrupulous exactitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seemed, for a moment, to doubt Anthony's identity; then the fire died,
      his eyes grew blank; his grasp relaxed on the stick, and, bent, dogged, he
      continued on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The repellent contraction of Anthony's heart expanded in a light and
      careless curiosity, youthful contempt mingled with the gayety of his
      morning mood, and he hastened his steps until he had again overtaken his
      inquisitor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a good cane you've got,&rdquo; he observed of the stout shaft and
      rounded head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its owner grasped it by the lower end, and swung the head against his
      hand. &ldquo;Lead,&rdquo; he pronounced somberly. &ldquo;It would crumble your skull like an
      egg.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again fear stirred vaguely in Anthony: the entire absence of emotion in
      the sanguinary, the dull, matter-of-fact voice were inhuman, tainted with
      madness; the total detachment of those deliberate words had been
      appalling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that you might have been Alfred Lukes, but
      you're too young.&rdquo; As he pronounced that name his grasp tightened whitely
      about the lead knob. The conviction seized Anthony that it was fortunate
      he was not the individual in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want Alfred?&rdquo; he asked in an attempted jocularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He murdered my boy,&rdquo; the other answered simply. &ldquo;Him and another. They
      asked James into a boat to go fishing. Boys will always go fishing; he was
      only eleven.&rdquo; He stopped in the middle of the road, and produced a small
      package folded in oiled silk. It proved to be a derringer, of an
      old-fashioned model, with two, short black barrels, one atop the other.
      &ldquo;Loaded,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to put against his face.&rdquo; Then he rewrapped the weapon
      and returned it to its place of concealment. &ldquo;I've been looking for Alfred
      Lukes for nineteen years,&rdquo; he recommenced his dogged progress, &ldquo;in trains
      and saloons and stores. Nineteen years ago James was found in the river.&rdquo;
       He was silent for a moment, then, &ldquo;One eye was torn out,&rdquo; he added in his
      weary voice. He turned his blank and terrible gaze upon Anthony, upon the
      sparkling morning. The derringer dragged slightly upon his coat, the stick&mdash;that
      stick which could crush a skull like an egg&mdash;made its trailing
      signature in the dust. A mingled loathing and pity took possession of
      Anthony; he recoiled from the corroding and secret horror of that nineteen
      year Odyssey of a torturing and impotent spirit of revenge, from the
      infinite black tide that had swept over the stooping figure at his side,
      the pitiless memory that had destroyed its sanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was on Sunday; James had on his nice blue suit and a new, red silk
      necktie... they found it knotted about his throat... as tight as a big man
      could make it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden impulse overcame Anthony to run, to leave far behind him this
      sinister, animated speck on the sunny road, under the dusty branches
      burdened with ripening fruit, thrilling with the bubbling notes of birds.
      But, as his gaze fell again upon his companion, he saw only an old man,
      gaunt with suffering, hurrying toward the noon. A deep, cleansing
      compassion vanquished the dread, and, spontaneously, he spoke of his own
      lighter affairs, of California, his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have never been west of Chicago,&rdquo; the other interposed. &ldquo;I hadn't the
      money; the walking is dreadfully hard; the sun on those plains hurt my
      head. Do you suppose James Lukes is in California?&rdquo; he asked, pausing
      momentarily in his rapid shamble.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his careless, youthful egotism, Anthony ignored the query. He wondered
      aloud where he could board a through train to the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you got your ticket?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony tapped complacently upon the pocket that held the wallet. They
      were walking now through a wood that flowed to the rim of the road, and a
      turn hid either vista. A stream ran through the rank greenery of the
      bottom, crossed by a bridge of loosely bolted planks. Anthony paused,
      intent upon the brown, sliding water beneath him, the minute minnows
      balancing against the stream. In that closed place of broken light the
      cool stillness was profound. The stream fled past its weeds without a
      gurgle, the leaves hung motionless, as though they had been stamped from
      metal... he might have been, with his companion, within a charmed circle
      of everlasting tranquillity. Then:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if Alfred Lukes is in California?&rdquo; the latter resumed; &ldquo;I've
      never got there, the fare... too expensive, the sun hurt my head.&rdquo; Anthony
      lit a Dulcina, and expelled a cloud of blue smoke that rose compactly in
      the motionless air. &ldquo;California,&rdquo; he repeated, sunk in thought; &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;California's a big place,&rdquo; Anthony hazarded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he was there I'd find him.&rdquo; Then, in his mechanical and dispassionate
      voice, he cursed Alfred Lukes with the utmost foulness. One heated word,
      the slightest elevation of his even tones, would have made the performance
      human, intelligent, but the deadly monotony, the impersonal accents, were
      as harrowing as though a mummy had ground out of its shrunken and embalmed
      interior a recital of prehistoric hatred and wrong; it resembled a
      phonograph record of incalculable depravity. He stood beyond the bridge,
      resting upon his stick, with his unmoved face turned toward Anthony. His
      hat cast a deep shade over his eyes; but, below, in a wanton patch of
      sunlight, his lipless mouth trembled greyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;California,&rdquo; he repeated still again, then, &ldquo;I must get there.&rdquo; He
      shifted his hand lower upon the stick, and moved nearer to Anthony by a
      step; the patch of sunlight shifted up to his hat and fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could try the freight cars,&rdquo; Anthony suggested. The stooping,
      neatly-brushed figure, the stony countenance, had become, in an intangible
      manner, menacing, obscurely dangerous. The fingers were drawn like a claw
      about the club. Then the arm relaxed, he seemed to shrink into hopeless
      resignation. Beyond the leafy arcade Anthony could now see the countryside
      spread out in sunny fields, fleecy, white clouds shifting in the sea of
      blue.... Suddenly a great flame shot up before his eyes, a stunning shock
      fell upon his head, and the flame went out in a whirling darkness that
      swept like a black sea over a continent of intolerable pain. He heard, as
      if from an immense distance, a thin voice pronounce the single word,
      &ldquo;California.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> GRIPPING wave of
      nausea recalled Anthony to consciousness; a deathly sickness spreading
      from the pit of his stomach through his entire being; his prostrate head,
      seeming stripped of its skull, was tortured by the dragging fronds of the
      ferns among which he lay. He sat up dizzily. Through the leafy opening the
      fleeting forms of the clouds shifted over the sunny hills. The stream
      slipped silently through the grass. He staggered down the slight incline,
      and, falling forward upon the ground, let the water flow over his
      throbbing head. The cool shock revived him, and he washed away a dark,
      clotted film from his forehead and cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wallet, with his ticket to California and store of money were gone. He
      started in instant, unsteady pursuit of the man who had struck him down
      and robbed him. But, at the edge of the wood he paused&mdash;how long had
      he lain among the ferns? the sun was now high over his head, the morning
      lapsed, the other might have had three, four hours' start. He might now be
      entrained, bound for California, searching for Alfred Lukes. A sudden
      weakness forced him to sit at the roadside; he lost consciousness again
      for a moment. Then, summoning his youth, his vitality, he rose, and walked
      unsteadily in search of assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had proceeded an intolerable mile, wiping away a thin trickle of blood
      that persisted in crawling into his eye, when he saw a low roof amid a
      tangle of greenery. He stopped with a sobbing breath of relief. He was
      delirious, he thought, for peering at him through the leaves he saw the
      countenance and beautiful, bare body of a child, as dark and tense as
      bronze. A cloud of black hair overhung a face vivid as a flower; her
      crimson lips trembled; then, with a startled cry, the figure vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      He made his way with difficulty over a short path, overgrown with vines
      and twisted branches, and came abruptly upon a low, white house and wide,
      opened door. An aged and shapeless woman sat on a chair without a back,
      cutting green beans into a bright tin basin. When she saw him she dropped
      the pan with a clatter, and an unfamiliar exclamation of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been hurt,&rdquo; Anthony explained; &ldquo;knocked silly and robbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gina!&rdquo; she called excitedly; &ldquo;Dio mio! <i>Gina!</i>&rdquo; A young woman, large
      and loosely molded, with a lusty baby clasped to her bared breast,
      appeared in the doorway. When she saw Anthony she dropped the baby into
      the elder's arms. &ldquo;Poverino!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;come in the house, little
      mister.&rdquo; She caught him by the arm, almost lifting him over the doorstep
      into a cool, dark interior. He had a brief glimpse of drying vegetables
      strung from the ceiling, of a waxen image of the virgin in faded pink silk
      finery against the wall; then, with closed eyes, he relaxed into the
      charge of soothing and skilled fingers. His head rested on a maternal arm
      while a soft bandage was fixed about his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ecco!&rdquo; she ejaculated, her ministration successful. She led him to a rude
      couch upon the floor, and gently insisted upon his lying down. He
      attempted to thank her, but she laid her large, capable hand over his
      mouth, and he sank into an exhausted, semi-conscious rest. Once she bent
      over him, dampening the bandage, once he saw, against the light of the
      door, the shape, slim and beautiful as an angel, of the child. Outside a
      low, liquid murmur of voices continued without a break, strange and
      quieting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He slept, and woke up refreshed, strengthened. The dusk had thickened in
      the room, the strings of vegetables were lost in the shadows, a dim oil
      lamp cast a feeble glow on rude walls. He lay motionless for a few,
      delightful seconds, folded in absolute peace, beneficent quietude. The
      amazing idea struck him that, perhaps, he had died, and that this was the
      eternal tranquillity of the hymn books, and he started vigorously to his
      feet in an absurd panic. The homely figure of a man entering dispelled the
      illusion&mdash;he was a commonplace Italian, one of the multitude who
      labored in the ditches of the country, stood aside in droves from the
      tracks as trains whirled past.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What hit your head?&rdquo; he asked, his mobile face displaying sympathetic
      interest, concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A leaded stick,&rdquo; Anthony explained. &ldquo;I was knocked out, robbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Birbanti!&rdquo; he laid a heavy hand upon Anthony's shoulder. &ldquo;You feel better
      now, gia?&rdquo; The latter, confused by such open attention, shook the hand
      from its friendly grip. &ldquo;He was crazy,&rdquo; he awkwardly explained; &ldquo;and
      looking for a man who had killed his son; he wanted to get to California
      and I told him I had a ticket west.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The laborer led Anthony to a room where a rude table was spread with
      homely fare&mdash;a great, rough loaf of bread, a deep bowl of steaming,
      green soup, flakey white cheese, and a bottle of purple wine. An open door
      faced the western sky, and the room was filled with the warm afterglow; it
      hung like a shining veil over the man, the still, maternal countenance of
      the woman, like an aureole about the baby now sleeping against her breast,
      and graced the russet countenance of an aged peasant. The child that
      Anthony had seen first, now in a scant white slip, seemed dipped in the
      gold of dreams.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he consumed the savory soup, the creamy cheese and wine, the scene
      impressed him as strangely significant, familiar. He dismissed an idle
      effort of memory in order to consider the unfortunate aspect assumed by
      his immediate affairs. Concerning one thing he was determined&mdash;he
      would ask his father to assist him no further toward his western
      destination. He must himself pay for the initial error, together with all
      its consequences, of having followed Hartmann: California was his object,
      he would not write to Ellerton until his westward progress was once more
      assured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two courses were open to him&mdash;he could &ldquo;beat&rdquo; his way, getting meals
      when and how he was able, riding, when possible, on freight cars, doing
      casual jobs on the way. That he dismissed in favor of a second, which in
      the end, he judged, would prove more speedy. He would make his way to the
      nearest city, find employment in a public or private garage as chauffeur
      or mechanic, and, in a month at most, have the money necessary for the
      continuation of his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The household conversed vigorously in their native idiom, giving his
      thoughts full freedom. The glow in the west faded, sank from the room,
      but, suddenly, he recognized the familiar quality of his surroundings. It
      resembled a picture of the Holy Family on the wall of his mother's room;
      the bare interior was the same, the rugged features of Joseph the
      carpenter, the brooding beauty of Mary. He almost laughed aloud at the
      absurd comparison of the exalted scene of Christ's infancy with this
      commonplace but kindly group, the laborer with soiled and callous hands
      and winestained mouth, the material young woman with the string of cheap
      blue beads.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meal at an end the chairs were pushed back and the old woman noisily
      assembled the dishes. Anthony's head throbbed and burned. In passing, the
      mother's fingers rested upon his brow. &ldquo;Not too hot,&rdquo; she nodded
      contentedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      A consultation followed. Anthony might remain there for the night; or, if
      he insisted, he might drive into the city with &ldquo;Nono,&rdquo; who left in a few
      hours with a wagonload of greens for the morning market. He chose the
      latter, with a clumsy expression of gratitude, impatient to resume active
      efforts in his rehabilitation in his own mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Niente!&rdquo; they disclaimed in chorus.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E fell into an
      instant slumber on the hospitable heap in the corner, and was awakened
      while it was still dark. In the flicker of the oil lamp the old man's face
      swam vaguely against the night. Without the wagon was loaded, a drooping
      horse insecurely harnessed into patched shafts. The world was a still
      space of blue gloom, of indefinite forms suspended in the hush of color,
      sound; it seemed to be spun out of shadows like cobwebs, out of vapors,
      scents. A pale, hectic glow on the horizon marked the city. They ambled
      noiselessly, slowly, forward, under the vague foliage of trees. There was
      a glint of light in a passing window, the clatter of milk pails; a rooster
      crowed, thin and clear and triumphant; on a grassy slope by the road they
      saw a smoldering fire, recumbent forms.
    </p>
    <p>
      They entered the soiled and ragged outskirts of the city&mdash;isolated
      ranks of hideous, boxlike dwellings amid raw stretches of clay, rank
      undergrowth. The horse's hoofs rang on a bricked pave, and the city surged
      about them. Overhead the elevated tracks made a confused, black tracing
      rippling with the red and white and green fire of signals. A gigantic
      truck, drawn by plunging horses whose armored hoofs were ringed in pale
      flame, passed with a shattering uproar of its metallic load. A train
      thundered above with a dolorous wail, showering a lurid trail of sparks
      into the sky, out of which a thick soot sifted down upon the streets. On
      either hand the blank walls of warehouses shut in the pavements deserted
      save for a woman's occasional, chalky countenance in the frosty area of
      the arc lights, or a drunkard lurching laboriously over the gutters. The
      feverish alarm of firebells sounded from a distant quarter. A heavy odor
      of stagnant oil, the fetid smoke of flaring chimneys, settled over
      Anthony, and gratefully he recalled the pastoral peace of the house he had
      left&mdash;the house hidden in its tangled verdure amid the scented space
      of the countryside.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stopped finally before a shed open upon the street, where
      bluish-orange flames, magnified by tin reflectors, illuminated busy
      groups. Silvery fish with exposed carmine entrails were ranged in rows;
      the crisp, green spoil of the countryside was spread in the stalls&mdash;the
      silken stalks of early onions, the creamy pink of carrots, wine-red beets;
      rosy potatoes were heaped by cool, crusty cantaloupe, the vert pods of
      peas, silvery spinach and waxy, purple eggplant. Over all hung the
      delicate aroma of crushed mint, the faint, sweet tang of scarlet
      strawberries, the spicy fragrance of simple flowers&mdash;of cinnamon
      pinks and heliotrope and clover.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony assisted the other to transfer his load to part of a stall
      presided over by a woman with bare, powerful elbows, shouting in a
      boisterous voice in perfect equality with her masculine neighbors.
    </p>
    <p>
      High above the dawn flushed the sky; the flares dimmed from a source of
      light to mere colored fans, and were extinguished. Early buyers arrived at
      the market with baskets and pushcarts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony remained at the old man's side; it was too early to start in
      search of work; and, at his companion's invitation, he shared the latter's
      breakfast of cheese and bread, with a stoup of the bitter wine. As the
      market became crowded, in the stress of competition, bargaining, the
      vendor forgot Anthony's presence; and with a deep breath of determination,
      he started in search of employment; he again faced the West.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had no difficulty in discovering the section of the city given over to
      the automobile industry, a broad, asphalt way with glittering show
      windows, serried ranks of cars, by either curb. There was, however, no
      work to be obtained here; a single offer would scarcely pay for his
      maintenance; in its potentialities California was the merest blur upon the
      future. Then for a second and more lucrative position he lacked the
      necessary papers. Midday found him without a prospect of employment. He
      had almost two dollars in change that had remained intact; and, lunching
      sparingly, he continued his inquiries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was late when he found himself before a sign that proclaimed the
      ability within to secure positions for competent chauffeurs. And,
      influenced largely by the chairs which he saw ranged against the wall, he
      entered and registered. The fee for registration was a dollar, and that
      left him with scant supplies as he took a place between three other men
      awaiting skeptically the positions which they had been assured they might
      confidently expect. With a casual nod to Anthony, a small man with watery
      blue eyes, clad in a worn and greasy livery, continued a dissertation on
      methods of making money additional to that of mere salary, of agreements
      with tiremen, repairs necessary and otherwise, the proper manner in which
      to bring a car's life quickly and gracefully to a close, in order, he
      added slyly to the indifferent clerk, to encourage the trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon wasted slowly but surely to a close; no one entered and the
      three rose with weary oaths and left in search of a convenient saloon.
      They waved to Anthony to follow them, but he silently declined.
    </p>
    <p>
      A profound depression settled over him, a sense of impotence, of failure.
      His wounded head fretted him with frequent hot pains. He was enveloped by
      a sense of desolating loneliness which he endeavored to dispel with the
      thought of Eliza; but she remained as far, as faintly sweet, as the moon
      of a spring night. It seemed incredible that she had once been in his
      arms; surely he had dreamed her voice&mdash;such voices couldn't exist in
      reality&mdash;telling him that she loved him. Her letter had gone with his
      wallet, his ticket to California. He had not written her... she would be
      unable to penetrate the reason for his silence, his shame for blundering
      into such a blind way, his lack of anything reassuring to tell her. He
      could not write until his feet were once more firmly planted upon the only
      path that led to success, to happiness, to her.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE clock on the
      wall above the clerk's head indicated half past five, and Anthony,
      relinquishing hope for the day, rose. Now he regretted the apparently
      fruitless expenditure of a dollar. &ldquo;Leave an address?&rdquo; the clerk inquired
      mechanically. &ldquo;Office open at nine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be back,&rdquo; Anthony told him. He turned, and collided with a man
      entering suddenly from the street. He was past middle age, with a long,
      pallid countenance, drooping snuff-colored mustache, a preoccupied gaze
      behind bluish glasses, and was clad in correct brown linen, but wore an
      incongruously battered and worn soft hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a man to drive my car,&rdquo; he announced abruptly. &ldquo;I don't
      particularly care for a highly expert individual, but his habits&mdash;&rdquo;
       he broke off, and muttered, &ldquo;superficial adjustment to environment&mdash;popular
      conception of acquired characteristics.&rdquo; Then, &ldquo;must be moderate,&rdquo; he
      ended unexpectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony lingered, while the clerk assured the other that several highly
      desirable individuals were available. &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; he told him, &ldquo;one left
      the office only a few minutes ago; I will have him call upon you in the
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; he replied, indicating Anthony; &ldquo;is he a chauffeur?&rdquo; The
      clerk nodded. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;the man I refer to is older, more
      experienced... sure to satisfy you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What references have you?&rdquo; the prospective employer demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None,&rdquo; Anthony answered directly. The clerk dismissed his chances with a
      gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What experience?&rdquo; the other persisted. &ldquo;Driving on and off for four or
      five years, and I am a fair mechanic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fair only?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The older man drew nearer to Anthony, scrutinizing him with a kindly
      severity. &ldquo;What's the matter with your head?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was knocked down and robbed on a country road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lose much?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drinking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Familiar with prehistoric geological strata?&rdquo; Anthony admitted that he
      was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had hoped,&rdquo; the other murmured, &ldquo;to get a driver who could assist me
      with my indices.&rdquo; He renewed his close inspection, then, &ldquo;Elemental,&rdquo; he
      pronounced suddenly; &ldquo;I'll take you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five dollars, please,&rdquo; interpolated the clerk. Outside his new employer
      took Anthony by the shoulder, glancing over his suit. &ldquo;You can get your
      things, and then go out to my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can go sooner than that,&rdquo; Anthony corrected him. &ldquo;I have no things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing but those clothes! Why... they will hardly do, will they? You
      must get something, take it out of your salary. But, hang it, a man must
      have a change of clothes! You must allow me&mdash;you are only a boy. I'll
      come along; no&mdash;impossible.&rdquo; He took a long wallet from his pocket
      and placed it in Anthony's hands. &ldquo;I don't know what such things cost,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I think there's enough; get what you need. I must be off...
      Mousterian deposits. Customs House.&rdquo; Before Anthony could reply he had
      started away in a long, quick stride, but he stopped short. &ldquo;My address,&rdquo;
       he cried, &ldquo;clean forgot.&rdquo; He gave Anthony a street and number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rufus Hardinge,&rdquo; he called, hurrying away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony stood gazing in incredulous surprise at the polished, brown wallet
      in his hand. He turned to hurry after the other, to protest, but already
      he was out of sight. Anthony slipped the wallet in his pocket, and, his
      head in a whirl, walked slowly over the street until he found himself
      opposite a large retail clothing establishment. After a brief hesitation
      he entered, pausing to glance hastily at his resources. In the leather
      pocket which contained the paper money he saw a comfortable number of
      crisp yellow bills; the rest of the space was taken up by bulky and wholly
      unintelligible notes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He purchased a serviceable suit, stout shoes, a cap, and, after a short
      consideration, two flannel shirts. If this were not satisfactory, he
      concluded, he could pay with a portion of his salary. The slip of the
      total amount, which he carefully folded, registered thirty-one dollars and
      seventy cents.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a small tobacco shop, where he drew upon his own rapidly diminishing
      capital, he discovered from the proprietor that it would be necessary to
      take a suburban car to the address furnished him. He rolled rapidly
      between rows of small, identical, orderly brick dwellings; on each shallow
      portico a door exhibited an obviously meretricious graining; dingy or
      garish curtains draped the single lower windows; the tin eaves were
      continuous, unvaried, monotonous. Occasionally a greengrocer's display
      broke the monotony of the vitreous way, a rare saloon or drugstore held
      the corners. Farther on the street suffered a decline, the line of
      dwellings was broken by patches of bedraggled gardens, set with the broken
      fragments of stone ornaments; small frame structures, streaked by the
      weather and blistered remnants of paint, alternated with stables, stores
      heaped with the sorry miscellanies of meager, disrupted households.
      Imperceptibly green spaces opened, foliage fluttered in the orange light
      of the declining sun; through an opening in the habited wall he caught
      sight of a glimmering stream, cows wandering against a hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left the car finally at a lane where the houses, set back solidly in
      smooth, opulent lawns, were somberly comfortable, reserved. The place he
      sought, a four-square ugly dwelling faced with a tower, the woodwork
      painted mustard yellow, was surrounded by gigantic tulip poplars. At the
      front a cement basin caught the spray from a cornucopia held aloft by
      sportive cherubs balanced precariously on the tails of reversed dolphins,
      circled by a tan-bark path to the entrance and a broad side porch. He was
      about to ring the bell when a high, young voice summoned him to the
      latter. There he discovered a girl with a mass of coppery hair, loosely
      tied and streaming over her shoulder, in a coffee-colored wicker chair.
      She was dressed in white, without ornaments, and wore pale yellow silk
      stockings. A yellow paper book, with a title in French, was spread upon
      her lap; and, gravely sitting at her side, was a large terrier with a
      shaggy yellow coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose,&rdquo; she said without preliminary, &ldquo;that you are the person who
      took father's money. It was really unexpected of you to appear with <i>any</i>
      of it. Give me the wallet,&rdquo; she demanded, without allowing him opportunity
      for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      He gave it to her without comment, a humorous light rising in his clear
      gaze. &ldquo;I warn you,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;I know every penny that was in it. I
      always give him a fixed amount when he goes out.&rdquo; She emptied the money
      into her lap, and counted it industriously: at the end she wrinkled her
      brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here is a note of what I spent,&rdquo; he informed her, tendering her the slip
      from the store. She scanned it closely. &ldquo;That's not unreasonable,&rdquo; she
      admitted finally, palpably disappointed that no villainous discrepancy had
      been revealed; &ldquo;and it adds up all right.&rdquo; Then, with an assumption of
      business despatch, &ldquo;It must come out of your salary, of course; father is
      frightfully impractical.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he assented solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your references&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made an impatient gesture of dismay; the terrier rose and surveyed him
      with a low growl. &ldquo;He promised me that he would do the thing properly,
      that I positively need not go. What experience have you had?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He told her briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dreadfully unsatisfactory,&rdquo; she commented, &ldquo;and you are oceans too young.
      But... we will try you for one week; I can't promise any more. Would you
      be willing to help a little in the house&mdash;opening boxes, unwrapping
      bones&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he assured her cheerfully, &ldquo;any little thing I can do....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The car's at the bottom of the garden, it has to be brought around by the
      side street. There's a room overhead, and a bell from the house. You must
      come up very quickly if, in the night, it rings three times, for that,&rdquo;
       she informed him, &ldquo;will mean burglars. My father and I are quite alone
      here with two women. I can't think of anything else now.&rdquo; The terrier
      moved closer to Anthony, sniffing at his shoes, then raised his golden
      eyes and subjected him to a lengthy, thoughtful scrutiny. &ldquo;That is Thomas
      Huxley,&rdquo; she informed him; &ldquo;he is a perfectly wonderful investigator, and
      detests all sentimentality. You will come up to the kitchen for meals,&rdquo;
       she called, as Anthony turned to descend the lawn; &ldquo;the bell will ring for
      your dinner.&rdquo;

      XXXIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E found the
      automobile in the semi-gloom of a closed carriage house. On the right,
      separated by a partition, were three loose stalls, apparently long
      unoccupied; their ornamental fringe of straw had moldered, and dank, grey
      heaps of feed lay in the troughs. A ladder fixed vertically against a wall
      disappeared into cobwebby shadows above; and mounting, Anthony found the
      room to which he had been directed. It, too, was partitioned from the
      great, bare space of the hay-loft; the musty smell of old hay and heated
      wood hung dusty, heavy, about the corners, where sounded the faint squeaks
      of scattering mice. The space which he was to occupy had been rigorously
      swept and aired; print curtains hung at the small dormer window that
      overlooked the lawn, while, above the washstand, was the bell which, he
      had been warned, would appraise him of the possible presence of burglars
      above. A bright metal clock ticked noisily on a deal bureau, and, on a
      table beside a pitcher and glass, two books had been arranged with precise
      disarray; they proved, upon investigation, to be a volume of the Edib.
      Rev. LXIX, and a bound collection of the proceedings of the Linean
      Society.
    </p>
    <p>
      He saw by the noisy clock that it was nearly seven, and, hastily washing,
      responded immediately to the summons of the bell. A small, covered porch
      framed the kitchen door, where he entered to find a long room dimly lit,
      and a dinner set at the end of a table. A bulky woman with a flushed
      countenance and massive ankles in white cotton stockings set before him
      half a broiled chicken, an artichoke with a bowl of yellow sauce, and a
      silver jug of milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows it's a queer meal to put to a hearty young lad,&rdquo; she observed;
      &ldquo;but it's all was ordered. There's not a pitata in the house,&rdquo; she added
      in palpable disgust. A younger woman in a frilled apron appeared from
      within, carrying a tray of used dishes. She had a trim figure, and a broad
      face glowing with rude vitality, which, with an assumption of disdain, she
      turned upon Anthony. &ldquo;I'd never trust myself with him in the machine,&rdquo; she
      observed to the older woman, &ldquo;and him not more than a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be holding your impudent clatter,&rdquo; the other commanded, &ldquo;you're not
      required to go out with him at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hardinge says, will you see him in the library when you have done,&rdquo;
       the former shot at Anthony over a shapely shoulder. &ldquo;You can walk through
      the dining room to where he is beyond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The library was a somber chamber: its long windows were draped with stiff
      folds of green velvet, its walls occupied by high bookcases with leaded
      glass doors and ornamental Gothic points under the ceiling. A massive desk
      was piled with papers, pamphlets, printed reports, comparative tables of
      figures, an hundred and one huddled details; the table beneath a
      glittering crystal chandelier was hardly better; even the floor was
      stacked with books about the chair where Anthony found his employer. The
      latter looked up absently from a printed sheet as Anthony entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Positively,&rdquo; he pronounced, &ldquo;there are not enough dominants to secure
      Mendel's position.&rdquo; His expression was profoundly disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Anthony replied non-committally. &ldquo;The consequences of that,&rdquo;
       the other continued, &ldquo;are beyond prediction.&rdquo; Silence descended upon him;
      his fixed gaze seemed to be contemplating some unexpected catastrophe,
      some grave peril, opened before him in the still chamber. &ldquo;I am at a
      temporary loss!&rdquo; he ejaculated suddenly; &ldquo;we are all at a loss... unless
      my experiments in pure descent warrant&mdash;&rdquo; Suddenly he became aware of
      Anthony's presence. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; he said pleasantly; &ldquo;glad you got fixed up. Say
      nothing more to Annot&mdash;it's all nonsense, taking it out of your
      salary. That's what I wanted to see you for,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;what salary do
      you require? what did you get at your last place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony made a swift calculation of the distance to California, the
      probable cost of carriage. &ldquo;I should like seventy-five,&rdquo; he pronounced
      finally. His conscience suddenly and uncomfortably awoke in the presence
      of the other's unquestioning generosity. &ldquo;Perhaps I'd better tell you that
      I don't intend to stay here long.... I am anxious to get to California.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Rufus Hardinge had already forgotten him. &ldquo;Seventy-five,&rdquo; he had
      murmured, with a satisfied nod, and once more concentrated his attention
      upon the sheet in his hand. As Anthony returned through the dining room he
      found Annot Hardinge arranging a spray of scarlet verbena in a glass vase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has father spoken to you about the salary you are to get?&rdquo; she asked. He
      paused, cap in hand. &ldquo;I told him that you were positively not to get above
      eighty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him seventy-five. He seemed contented.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He would have been contented if you had said seven hundred and fifty.&rdquo;
       Then, to discountenance any criticism of her father's intelligence, she
      added: &ldquo;He is a very famous biologist, you know. The people about here
      don't understand those things, but in London, in Paris, in Berlin, he is
      easily one of the greatest men alive. He is carrying the Mendelian theory
      to its absolute, logical conclusion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said something about that to me,&rdquo; Anthony commented; &ldquo;it seemed to
      upset him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A cloud appeared upon her countenance; then, coldly, &ldquo;That will do,&rdquo; she
      told him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once more in the informal garage he lit the gas jet on either wall, and,
      in the bubbling, watery light, found the automobile caked with mud and
      grease, the tires flat, the wires charred and the cylinders coated with
      carbon. A pair of old canvas trousers were hanging from a nail, and,
      donning them and connecting a length of hose to a convenient faucet, he
      began the task of putting the machine in order. It was past eleven when he
      finished for the night, and mounting with cramped and stiffened muscles to
      his room, he fell into immediate slumber.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the following
      morning he wrote a brief, reassuring note to his father; then, over
      another page, hesitated with poised pen. &ldquo;Dear Eliza,&rdquo; he finally began,
      then once more fell into indecision. &ldquo;I wish I were back on the
      Wingo-hocking with you,&rdquo; he embarked. &ldquo;That was splendid, having you in
      the canoe, with no one else; the whole world seemed empty except for you
      and me. It's no joke of an emptiness without you.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been delayed in reaching California, but I'll soon be out there
      now, working like thunder for our wedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mostly I can't realize it, it's too good to be true&mdash;you seem like a
      thing I dreamed about, in a dream all full of moonlight and white flowers.
      It's funny but I smell lilacs, you know like you picked, everywhere. Last
      night, cleaning a car just soaked in dirt and greasy smells, that perfume
      came out of nothing, and hung about so real that it hurt me. And all the
      time I kept thinking that you were standing beside me and smiling. I knew
      better, but I had to look more than once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love's different from what I thought it would be; I thought it would be
      all happy, but it's not that, it's blamed serious. I am always flinching
      from blows that might fall on you, do you see? Before I went away I saw a
      man kiss a woman, and they both seemed scared; I understand that now&mdash;they
      loved each other.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He broke off and gazed out the narrow window over the feathery tops of
      maples, the symmetrical, bronze tops of a clump of pines. The odor of
      lilacs came to him illusively; he was certain that Eliza was standing at
      his shoulder; he could hear a silken whisper, feel an intangible thrill of
      warmth. He turned sharply, and faced the empty room, the bright,
      stentorious clock, the table with the pitcher and glass and serious
      volumes. &ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; he exclaimed in angry remonstrance at his credulity.
      Still shaken by the reality of the impression he wondered if he were
      growing crazy? The bell above the washstand rang sharply, and, putting the
      incomplete letter in a drawer, he proceeded over the tanbark path that led
      to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annot Hardinge beckoned to him from the porch, and, turning, he passed a
      conservatory built against the side of the dwelling, where he saw small,
      identical plants ranged in mathematical rows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; she demanded abruptly, as he stopped before her.
      &ldquo;Anthony,&rdquo; he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was dressed in apricot muslin, with a long necklace of alternate
      carved gold and amber beads, dependent amber earrings, and a flapping
      white hat with broad, yellow ribbands that streamed downward with her
      hair. In one hand she held a pair of crumpled white gloves and a soft gold
      mesh bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may bring around the car... Anthony,&rdquo; she directed. &ldquo;I want to go
      into town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the heart of the shopping district they moved slowly in an unbroken
      procession of motor landaulets, open cars and private hansoms, a
      glittering, colorful procession winding through the glittering, colorful
      cavern of the shop windows. The sidewalks were thronged with women,
      brilliant in lace and dyed feathers and jewels, the thin, sustained babble
      of trivial voices mingled with the heavy, coiling odors of costly
      perfumes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a small heap of bundles had been accumulated a rebellious expression
      clouded An-not Hardinge's countenance. &ldquo;Stop at that confectioner's,&rdquo; she
      directed, indicating a window filled with candies scattered in a creamy
      tide, bister, pale mauve, and citrine, over fluted, delicately green
      satin, against a golden mass of molasses bars. She soon emerged, with a
      package tied in silver cord, and paused upon the curb. &ldquo;I want to go
      out... out, into the heart of the country,&rdquo; she proclaimed; &ldquo;this crowd,
      these tinsel women, make me ill. Drive until I tell you to stop... away
      from everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When they had left the tangle of paved streets, the innumerable stone
      façades, she directed their course into a ravine whose steep sides were
      covered with pines, at the bottom of which a stream foamed whitely over
      rocky ledges. Beyond, they rose to an upland, where open, undulating hills
      burned in the blue flame of noon; at their back a trail of dust resettled
      upon the road, before them a glistening flock of peafowl scattered with
      harsh, threatening cries. By a gnarled apple tree, whose ripening June
      apples overhung the road, she called, &ldquo;stop!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The motor halted in the spicy, dappled shadow of the tree; at one side a
      cornfield spread its silken, green tapestry; on the other a pasture was
      empty, close-cropped, rising to a coronal of towering chestnuts. The road,
      in either direction, was deserted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony heard a sigh of contentment at his back: relaxed from the tension
      of driving he removed his cap, and, with crossed legs, contemplated the
      sylvan quiet. He watched a flock of blackbirds wheeling above the apple
      tree, and decided that they had been within easy shot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look over your head!&rdquo; she cried suddenly; &ldquo;what gorgeous apples.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose, and, measuring the distance in a swift glance, jumped, and caught
      hold of a limb, by means of which he drew himself up into the tree. He
      mounted rapidly, filling his cap with crimson apples; when his pockets
      were full he paused. Down through the screen of leaves he could see her
      upturned countenance, framed in the broad, white hat; her expression was
      severely impersonal; yet, viewed from that informal angle, she did not
      appear displeased. And, when he had descended, she picked critically among
      the store he offered. She rolled back the gloves upon her wrists, and bit
      largely, with youthful gusto. On the road, after a moment's hesitation,
      Anthony embarked upon the consumption of the remainder. He strolled a
      short distance from the car, and found a seat upon a low stone-wall.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>OON, he saw, she
      too left the car, and passed him, apparently ignorant of his presence.
      But, upon her return, she stopped, and indicated with her foot some
      feathery plants growing in a ditch by the road. &ldquo;Horsetails,&rdquo; she
      declared; &ldquo;they are Paleozoic... millions of years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They look fresh and green still,&rdquo; he observed. She glanced at him coldly,
      but his expression was entirely serious. &ldquo;I mean the species of course.
      Father has fossils of the Devonian period... they were trees then.&rdquo; She
      chose a place upon the wall, ten feet or more from him, and sat with
      insolent self-possession, whistling an inconsequential tune. There was
      absolutely no pose about her, he decided; she possessed a masculine
      carelessness in regard to him. She leaned back, propped upon her arms, and
      the frank, flowing line of her full young body was like the June day in
      its uncorseted freedom and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will get that package from the confectioner's&mdash;&rdquo; she
      suggested finally. She unfolded the paper, and exposed a row of small
      cakes, which she divided rigorously in two; rewrapping one division she
      held it out toward him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he protested seriously. &ldquo;I'm not hungry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's past two,&rdquo; she informed him, &ldquo;and we can't possibly be back in time
      for luncheon. I'd rather not hold this out any longer.&rdquo; He relieved her
      without further words. &ldquo;Two brioche and two babas,&rdquo; she enumerated. He
      resumed his place, and then consumed the cakes without further speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The study of biology,&rdquo; she informed him later, with a gravity appropriate
      to the subject, &ldquo;makes a great many small distinctions seem absurd. When
      you get accustomed to thinking in races, and in millions of years, the
      things your friends fuss about seem absurd. And so, if you like, why,
      smoke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was his constant plight that, between the formal restrictions of his
      position, and the vigorous novelty of her speech, Anthony was constantly
      at a loss. &ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; he replied inanely; &ldquo;I know nothing about those
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She flashed over him a candid, amber gaze that singularly resembled her
      father's. &ldquo;You are not at all acquisitive,&rdquo; she informed him; &ldquo;and it's
      perfectly evident that you are the poorest sort of chauffeur. You drive
      very nicely,&rdquo; she continued with severe justice. &ldquo;One could trust you in a
      crisis; but it is little things that make a chauffeur, and in the little
      things,&rdquo; she paused to indicate a globe of cigarette smoke that instantly
      dissolved, &ldquo;you are like&mdash;that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moodily acknowledged to himself the truth of her observation, but such
      acumen he considered entirely unnecessary in one so young; he did not
      think it becoming. He contrasted her, greatly to her detriment, with the
      elusive charm of Eliza Dreen; the girl before him was too vivid, too
      secure; he felt instinctively that she was entirely free from the bonds,
      the conventions, that held the majority of girls within recognized,
      convenient limits. Her liberty of mind upset a balance to which both
      heredity and experience had accustomed him. The entire absence of a
      tacitly recognized masculine superiority subconsciously made him uneasy,
      and he took refuge in imponderable silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she continued airily, &ldquo;you are too physically normal to think,
      all normal people are stupid.... You are like one of those wood creatures
      in the classic pastorals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A faint grin overspread Anthony's countenance; among so many
      unintelligible words he had regained his poise&mdash;this was the usual,
      the familiar feminine chatter, endless, inconsequential, by means of which
      all girls presented the hopeless tangle of their thoughts and emotions;
      its tone had deceived him only at the beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the stillness which followed other blackbirds, equally within shot,
      winged over the apple tree; the shadow of the boughs crept farther and
      farther down the road. She rose vigorously. &ldquo;I must get back,&rdquo; she
      announced. She remained silent during the return, but Anthony, with the
      sense of direction cultivated during countless days in the fields and
      swales, found the way without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she left the car he slowly backed and circled to the carriage house.
      As he splashed body and wheels with water, polished the metal, dried and
      dusted the cushions, the crisp, cool voice of Annot Hardinge rang in his
      ears. He divined something of her isolated existence, her devotion to the
      absorbed, kindly man who was her father, and speculated upon her matured
      youth. She recalled his sister Ellie, for whose inflexible integrity he
      cherished a deep-seated admiration; but both left him cold before the
      poignant tenderness of Eliza... Eliza, the unforgettable, who loved him.

      unsubstantial dinner of grilled sweetbreads and mushrooms, and a frozen
      pudding, he continued his interrupted letter: &ldquo;But there isn't any use in
      my trying to write my love in words; it won't go into words, even inside
      of me I can't explain it&mdash;it seems as if instead of its being a part
      of me that I am a part of it, of something too big for me to see the end
      of.&rdquo; Then he became practicable, and wrote optimistically of the things
      that were soon to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a letter box at the upper corner of the street, and, passing the
      porch, he saw the biologist sunk in an attitude of profound dejection. His
      daughter sat with bare arms and neck at his side; her hair was bound in a
      gleaming mass about her ears, and one hand was laid upon the man's
      shoulder, while she patted Thomas Huxley with the other. The dog rose,
      growling belligerently at the unfamiliar figure, but sank again beneath a
      sharp command. When he returned Rufus Hardinge greeted him, and turned to
      his daughter with a murmured suggestion, but she shook her head in
      decisive negation. A light shone palely in the long windows at their back.
      The sun, at its skyey, evening toilette, seemed, in the rosy glow of
      westering candles, to scatter a cloud of powdered gold over the worn and
      huddled shoulders of the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, seemingly in reconsideration of her decision, she called, &ldquo;Oh,
      Anthony!&rdquo; and he retraced his steps to the porch. &ldquo;My father suggests that
      you sit here,&rdquo; she told him distantly. &ldquo;He says that you are very young,
      and that solitude is not good for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Annot,&rdquo; the older man protested humorously, &ldquo;you have mangled my intent
      beyond any recognition.&rdquo; With an unstudied, friendly gesture he tended
      Anthony his cigar case. A deep preoccupation enveloped him; he sat with
      loose hands and unseeing eyes. In the deepening twilight his countenance
      was grey. Anthony had taken a position upon the edge of the porch, his
      feet in the fragrant grass, out of which fireflies rose glimmering,
      mounting higher and higher, until, finally, they disappeared into the
      night above, in the pale birth of the stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      A deep silence enfolded them until in an unexpected, low voice, Rufus
      Hardinge repeated mechanically aloud lines called, evidently, out of a
      memory of long ago:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      ''Within thy beams, Oh, Sun! or who could find,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      While fly, and leaf, and insect stood revealed,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      That too,&rdquo; he paused, groping in his memory for
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      the words:
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;That too such countless orbs thou madst us
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      blind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl rose, and drew his head into her warm, young arms. &ldquo;Don't,
      father,&rdquo; she cried, in a sudden, throbbing apprehension; &ldquo;please...
      please. You have the clearest, most beautiful eyes in the world. Think of
      all they have seen and understood&mdash;&rdquo; He patted her absently. Anthony
      moved silently away.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>OT long after, at
      breakfast, the young and disdainful maid conveyed to Anthony a request to
      proceed, when he had finished, to the conservatory. There he discovered
      Annot Har-dinge, with her sleeves rolled up above her vigorous elbows,
      dusting with a fine, brown powder the rows of monotonous, potted plants.
      She directed him to follow her with a slender-nosed watering pot. He
      wondered silently at the featureless display of what he found to be
      ordinary bean plants, some of the dwarf variety, others drawn up against
      the wall. They bore in exact, minute inscriptions, strange names and
      titles, cryptic numbers; some, he saw, were labelled &ldquo;Dominants,&rdquo; others,
      &ldquo;Recessives.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The 'cupids' are doing wretchedly, poor dears!&rdquo; she exclaimed before a
      row of dwarf sweet peas. &ldquo;This is my father's laboratory,&rdquo; she told him
      briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought he had something to do with Darwin and the missing link.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him pityingly from the heights of a vast superiority. &ldquo;Darwin
      did some valuable preliminary work,&rdquo; she instructed him; &ldquo;although Wallace
      really guessed it all first. Now Mendel, Bateson, are the important names.
      They were busy with the beginnings; and, among the beginnings, plants are
      the most suggestive.&rdquo; She indicated a small row of budding sweet peas.
      &ldquo;Perhaps, in those flowers, the whole secret of the universe will be
      found; perhaps the mystery of our souls will be explained; isn't it
      thrilling! The secret of inheritance may sleep in those buds&mdash;if they
      are white it will prove... oh, a thousand things, and among them that
      father is the most wonderful scientist alive; it will explain heredity and
      control it, make a new kind of world possible, a world without the most
      terrible diseases. What church, what saint, what god, has really done
      that?&rdquo; she demanded. &ldquo;Stupid priggish figures bending out of their
      gold-plated heavens!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her enthusiasm communicated a thrill to him as he regarded the still,
      withdrawn mystery of the plants. For the first time he thought of them as
      alive, as he was alive; he imagined them returning his gaze, his interest,
      exchanging&mdash;critically, in their imperceptible, chaste tongue&mdash;their
      unimpassioned opinions of him. It was a disturbing possibility that the
      secret of his future, of life and death, might lurk in the flowers to
      unfold on those slender stems. He was oppressed by a feeling of a world
      crowded with invisible, living forms, of fields filled with billions of
      grassy inhabitants, of seas, mountains, made up of interlocking and
      contending lives; every breath, he felt, absorbed races of varied
      individuals. He thought, too, of people as plants, as roses&mdash;Oh,
      Eliza!&mdash;as nettles, rank weeds, crimson lilies. And, vaguely, this
      hurt him; something valuable, something sustaining, vanished from his
      unformulated, instinctive conception of life; the world of men, their
      aims, their courage, ideals, lost their peculiar beauty, their importance;
      the past, rising from the mold through those green tubes and vanishing
      into a future of dissolving gases, shrunk, stripped of its glamor, to an
      affair of little moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, as he descended the lawn, the sun had the artificial glitter of
      an incandescent light; the trees waved their arms at him threateningly.
      Then, with a shrug of his normal young shoulders, he relinquished the
      entire conception; he forgot it. He recklessly permeated a universe of
      airy atoms with the smoke of a Dulcina. &ldquo;That's a woolly delusion,&rdquo; he
      pronounced.
    </p>
    <p>
      That evening he burnished the car, and mounted the ladder to his room
      late. But the evening following, detained to perform a trivial task, found
      him seated upon the porch, enveloped in the fragrant clouds of Habana
      leaf.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>NNOT, as now he
      mentally termed her, dressed in the inevitable yellow, was swinging a
      satin slipper on the point of her foot; her father was, if possible, more
      greyly withdrawn than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night,&rdquo; the biologist finally addressed his daughter, &ldquo;your mother has
      been dead eighteen years.... She hated science; she said it had destroyed
      my heart. Impossible&mdash;a purely functionary pump. The illusions of
      emotions are cerebro-spinal reflexes, only that. She said that I cared
      more for science than&mdash;than herself.&rdquo; He raised his head sharply, &ldquo;I
      was forced to tell her the truth, in common honor: science first.... Tears
      are an automatic escapement to protect the vision. But women have no
      logic, little understanding; hopelessly romantic, a false quantity&mdash;romance,
      dangerous. I was away when she died ... Borneo, Aurignacian strata had
      been discovered, a distinct parallel with the Maurer jaw. Death is only a
      change of chemical activity,&rdquo; he shot at Anthony in a voice not entirely
      steady, &ldquo;the human entity a passing agglomeration, kinetic.... Love is a
      mechanical principle, categorically imperative,&rdquo; his voice sank, became
      diffuse. &ldquo;Absolute science, selfless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;People found her beautiful, I didn't know,&rdquo; he added wistfully; &ldquo;beauty
      is a vague term. The Chapelle skull is beautiful, as I understand it, as I
      understand it. In a letter to me,&rdquo; after a long pause, &ldquo;she employed the
      term 'frozen to death'; she said that I had frozen her to death. Only a
      figure, romantic, inexact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stuff!&rdquo; Annot exclaimed lightly, but her anxious countenance contradicted
      the spirit of her tones. &ldquo;You mustn't stir about in old troubles.
      Everything great demands sacrifice; mother didn't quite understand; and I
      expect she got lonely, poor dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony rose, and made his way somberly toward the stable, but running
      feet, his name called in low, urgent tones, arrested his progress. An-not
      approached with the trouble deepening in her gaze. &ldquo;Does he seem entirely
      himself to you?&rdquo; she asked, but, before he could answer,&mdash;&ldquo;of course,
      you don't know him well enough. You see, he is working too much again, an
      average of sixteen hours for the ten days past. I haven't said anything
      because the most difficult part of his work is at an end. If his last
      conclusions are right he will have only to scribble the reports, put a
      book together.... I can always tell when he is overworked by the cobwebs&mdash;he
      tries to brush them off his face,&rdquo; she explained. &ldquo;They don't exist, of
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I really wanted to say this,&rdquo; she lifted her candid gaze to his face.
      &ldquo;Could you be a little more about the house? we might need you; we'll use
      the car very little for a while.&rdquo; The apprehension was clearly visible
      now. &ldquo;Would you mind helping him with his clothes; he gets them mixed? It
      isn't regular, I know,&rdquo; she told him; &ldquo;but we have a great deal of money;
      anything you required&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps I'd be better at that,&rdquo; he suggested. &ldquo;You know, you said I was a
      rotten chauffeur.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment, appealing, she had seemed nearer to him, but now she
      retreated spiritually, slipped behind her cold indifference. &ldquo;There will
      be nothing more to-night; if he grows worse you will have to move into the
      house.&rdquo; She left him abruptly, gathering her filmy skirt from the grass,
      an elusive shape with gleams on her hair, her arms and neck white for an
      instant and then veiled in the scarf of night.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his room he could still hear, mingled with the faint, muffled squeaking
      of the mice in the empty hayloft, Hardinge's voice, jerky, laborious, &ldquo;a
      categorical imperative... categorical imperative.&rdquo; He wondered what that
      meant applied to love? An errant air brought him the unmistakable odor of
      white lilacs, an ineffable impression of Eliza.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE day following
      found him installed in the house, in a small chamber formed where the
      tower fronted upon the third story. At luncheon a place was laid for him
      at the table with Annot and her father, where the attentions of the
      disdainful and shapely maid positively quivered with suppressed scorn.
      Anthony had found in his room fifty dollars in an envelope, upon which
      Annot had scribbled that he might need a few things; and, at liberty in
      the afternoon, he boarded an electric car for the city, where he invested
      in fresh and shining pumps, and other necessities.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was dark when he inserted his newly acquired latchkey in the
      front door and made his way softly aloft. But a thread of light was
      shining under the door of Rufus Har-dinge's study. Later&mdash;he had just
      turned out the light&mdash;a short knock fell upon his door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me,&rdquo; Annot answered his instant query. &ldquo;I am going to ask you to dress
      and come to my father. It may be unnecessary; he may go quietly to bed;
      but go he must.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He found her in a dressing gown that fell in heavy, straight folds of
      saffron satin, her feet thrust in quaint Turkish slippers with curled
      points; while over her shoulders slipped and slid the coppery rope of her
      hair. She led the way to the study, which she entered without knocking.
      Anthony saw the biologist bent over pages spread in the concentrated light
      of a green shaded globe. In a glass case against the wall some moldy bones
      were mounted and labelled; fragmentary and sinister-appearing casts
      gleamed whitely from a stand; and, everywhere, was the orderly confusion
      of books and papers that had distinguished the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Rufus,&rdquo; Annot laid her hand upon his shoulder; &ldquo;it's bedtime for
      all scientists. You promised me you would be in by eleven.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gazed at her with the hasty regard directed at an ill-timed, casual
      stranger. &ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; he ejaculated impatiently, &ldquo;get to bed. I'll
      follow... some crania tracings, prognathic angles&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow will do for those,&rdquo; she insisted gently, &ldquo;you are making
      yourself ill again&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; he interrupted, &ldquo;never felt better in my life, never&mdash;&rdquo;
       his voice dwindled abruptly to silence, as though a door had been closed
      on him; his lips twisted impotently; beads of sweat stood out upon his
      white, strained forehead. His whole body was rigid in an endeavor to
      regain his utterance. He rose, and would have fallen, if Annot's arm had
      not slipped about his shoulders. Anthony hurried forward, and, supporting
      him on either side, they assisted him into the sleeping chamber beyond.
      There, at full length on a couch, a sudden, marble-like immobility fell
      upon his features, his mouth slightly open, his hands clenched. Annot
      busied herself swiftly, while Anthony descended into the dark, still house
      in search of ice. When he returned, Hardinge was pronouncing disconnected
      words, terms. &ldquo;Eoliths,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;snow line... one hundred and thirty
      millimeters.&rdquo; He was silent for a moment, then, struggling into a sitting
      posture, &ldquo;Annot!&rdquo; he cried sharply, &ldquo;I've frightened you again. Only a
      touch of... aphasia; unfortunately not new, my dear, but not serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Later, when Anthony had assisted him in the removal of his clothes, and
      lowered the light, he found Annot in the study assembling the papers
      scattered on the table. &ldquo;I am glad that you are here,&rdquo; she said simply.
      &ldquo;Soon he can have a complete rest.&rdquo; She sank into a chair; he had had no
      idea that she could appear so lovely: her widely-opened eyes held flecks
      of gold; beneath the statuesque fall of the dressing gown her bare ankles
      were milky-white.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E felt strangely
      at ease in a setting so easily strange. There was a palpable flavor of
      unreality in the moment, of detachment from the commonplace round of
      existence; it was without connection, without responsibility to yesterday
      or to to-morrow; he was isolated with the informal vision of Annot in an
      hour which seemed neither day nor night. He felt&mdash;inarticulately&mdash;divorced
      from his customary daily personality; and, with no particular need for
      speech, lit a cigarette, and blew clouds of smoke at the ceiling. It was
      his companion who interrupted this mood.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The life that people think so tremendously important,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;the
      things one does, are hardly more real than a suit of clothes, with
      religion for a nice, prim white collar, gloves for morals, and a hidden
      red silk handkerchief for a rare revolt. And all the time, politely
      ignored, decently covered, our bodies are underneath. Now and then some
      one slips out of his covering, and stands bare before his shocked and
      protesting friends, but they soon hurry something about him, a
      conventional shawl, a moral sheet. Do you happen to remember a wonderful
      caricature of Louis XIV&mdash;simply a wig, a silk suit, buckled shoes and
      a staff?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mordant humor of that drawing penetrated Anthony's understanding: he
      saw rooms, streets, a world full of gesticulating suits, dresses, nodding
      hats, bonnets; he saw the unsubstantial concourse haughtily erect,
      condescending, cunningly deceptive, veiling in a thousand subterfuges
      their essential emptiness. The thought evaporated in laughter at the
      obvious humor of such a spectacle; its social significance missed him
      totally, happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an unthinking person you are,&rdquo; she told him; &ldquo;you just&mdash;live.
      It's rather remarkable&mdash;one of Bacchus' company caught in the modern
      streets. It is all so different now,&rdquo; she added plaintively; &ldquo;men get
      drunk in saloons or at dinner, and the purple stain of the grape centers
      in their noses. I tried myself,&rdquo; she confessed, &ldquo;in Geneva. I was with a
      specialist who had father. The café balcony overhung the lake; it was at
      night, and the villages looked like clusters of fireflies about a black
      mirror; and you simply never saw so many stars. We were looking for a
      lyric sensation, but it was the most awful fizzle; he insisted on
      describing an operation with all the grey and gory details complete, and I
      fell fast asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The outcome of her experiment tallied exactly with that of his own more
      involuntary efforts in that field. It established in his mind a singularly
      direct sympathy with her; the uneasy element which her attitude had called
      up in him disappeared entirely, its place taken by a comfortable sense of
      freedom, a total lack of <i>rot</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, vanishing into her father's room, then, coming to the door,
      nodded shortly, and left for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found on the bureau in his tower room what remained of the fifty
      dollars&mdash;it had been reduced to less than eight. Suddenly he
      remembered his purpose there, his supreme need of money, the imperative
      westward call.... He bitterly cursed his lax character as he recalled the
      cigars he had purchased, the silk shirt too, and an unnecessary tie. A
      deep gloom settled upon his spirit. He heard in retrospect his father's
      clear, high voice&mdash;&ldquo;shiftless, no sense of responsibility.&rdquo; He sat
      miserably on the edge of the bed in the dark, while the petty, unbroken
      procession of past failures wheeled through his brain. Then the shining
      vision of Eliza, compassionate, tender, folded him in peace; one by one he
      would subdue those rebellious elements in himself, of fate, that held them
      apart.

      breakfast the incident of the preceding night seemed fantastic, unreal; he
      retained the broken, vivid memory of the scene, the thrill of vague words,
      that lingers disturbingly into the waking world from a dream. And, when he
      saw Annot later, there was no trace of a consequent informality in her
      manner; she was distant, hedged about by an evident concern for her
      father. &ldquo;I have sent for Professor Jamison.&rdquo; She addressed Anthony with
      blank eyes. &ldquo;Please be within call in case&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw the neurologist as the latter circled the plaster cupids to the
      entrance of the house&mdash;a heavy man with a broad, smooth face,
      thinlipped like a priest, with staring yellow gloves. Anthony remained in
      the lower hall, but no demand for his assistance sounded from above. When
      the specialist descended, he flashed a glance, as bitingly swift and cold
      as glacial water, over Anthony, then nodded in the direction of the
      garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Annot tells me that you are sleeping in the house,&rdquo; he said when
      they were outside; &ldquo;on the chance that she might need you for her
      father... she will. He is at the point of mental dissolution.&rdquo; An
      involuntary repulsion possessed Anthony at the detached manner in which
      the other pronounced these hopeless words. &ldquo;Nothing may be done; that is&mdash;it
      is not desirable that anything should. I am telling you this so that you
      can act intelligently. Rufus Hardinge knows it; there was a consultation
      at Geneva, which he approved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; he continued with a warmer, more personal note, &ldquo;a very
      distinguished biologist; his investigations, his conclusions, have been
      invaluable.&rdquo; He glanced at an incongruous, minute, jewelled watch on his
      wrist, and continued more quickly. &ldquo;Ten years ago he should have stopped
      all work, vegetated&mdash;he was burning up rapidly; merely a reduced
      amount of labor would have accomplished little for his health or subject.
      And we couldn't spare his labor, no mere prolongation of life would have
      justified that loss of knowledge, progress. It was his position; he
      insisted upon it and we concurred... he chose... insanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Annot is not aware of this; he must have every moment possible;
      every note is priceless. The end will come&mdash;now, at any time.&rdquo; He had
      reached the small, canary yellow Dreux landaulet waiting for him, and
      stepped into it with a sharp nod. &ldquo;You may expect violence,&rdquo; he added, as
      the car gathered momentum.
    </p>
    <p>
      But that evening in the dim quietude of the piazza the biologist seemed to
      have recovered completely his mental poise. He spoke in a buoyant vein of
      the great men he had known, celebrated names in the world of the arts, in
      politics and science. He recalled Braisted, the astronomer, searching
      relaxation in the Boulevard school of French fictionists. &ldquo;I told him,&rdquo; he
      chuckled at the mild, scholastic humor, &ldquo;that he had been peeping too long
      at Venus.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Annot was steeped in an inscrutable silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time, Anthony was actually aware of her features: she had a
      broad, low brow swept by the coppery hair loosely tied at the back; her
      eyes resembled her father's, they were amber-colored, and singularly
      candid in their interest in all that passed before them; while her nose
      tilted up slightly above a mouth frankly large. It was the face of a boy,
      he decided, but felt instantly that he had fallen far short of the fact&mdash;the
      allurement, the perfection, of her youthful maturity hung overwhelmingly
      about her the challenge of sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rather, she was all girl, he recognized, but of a new variety. A vision of
      <i>the nice</i> girls he had known dominated his vision, flooded his mind,
      all smiling with veiled eyes, clothed in a thousand reserves, fluttering
      graces, innocent wiles, with their gaze firmly set toward the shining,
      desirable goal of matrimony. Eliza was not like that, it was true; but
      she, from the withdrawn, impersonal height of her cool perfection, was a
      law to herself. There was a new freedom in Annot's acceptance of life, he
      realized vaguely, as different as possible from mere license; no one, he
      was certain, would presume with Annot Hardinge: her very frankness offered
      infinitely less incentive to unlawful thoughts than the conscious modesty
      of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the biologist left the piazza Annot turned with a glad gesture to her
      companion. &ldquo;He hasn't seemed so well&mdash;not for years; his little, gay
      fun again... it's too good to be true. I should like to celebrate&mdash;something
      entirely irresponsible. I have worried, oh, dreadfully.&rdquo; The night was
      still, moonless; the stars burned like opals in the intense purple deeps
      of the sky. The air, freighted with the rich fruitage of full summer, hung
      close and heavy. &ldquo;It's hot as a blotter,&rdquo; Annot declared. &ldquo;I think, yes&mdash;I'm
      sure, I should like to go out in the car.&rdquo; She rose. &ldquo;Will you bring it
      around, please?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drove slowly over the deserted lane by the lawn, and found her,
      enveloped in the lustrous folds of a black satin wrap, at the front gate.
      Over her hair she had tied a veil drawn about her brow in a webby filament
      of flowers &ldquo;I think I'll sit in front,&rdquo; she decided; &ldquo;perhaps I'll drive.&rdquo;
       He waited, at the steering wheel, for directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go west, young man,&rdquo; she told him, and would say nothing more. A distant
      bell thinly struck eleven jarring notes as they moved into the flickering
      gloom of empty streets with the orange blur of lamps floating unsteadily
      on dim boughs above, and the more brilliant, crackling radiance of the arc
      lights at the crossings.
    </p>
    <p>
      The headlights of the automobile cut like white knives through the
      obscurity of hedged ways; at sudden turnings they plunged into gardens,
      flinging sharply on the shadowy night vivid glimpses of incredible
      greenery, unearthly flowers, wafers of white wall. They drove for a long,
      silent period, with increasing momentum as the way became more open and
      direct; now they seemed scarcely to touch the uncertain surface below, but
      to be wheeling through sheer space, flashing their stabbing incandescence
      into the empty envelopment beyond the worlds.
    </p>
    <p>
      They passed with a muffled din through the single street of a sleeping
      village, leaving behind a confusion of echoes and the startled barking of
      a dog. Anthony could see Annot's profile, pale and clear, against the
      flying and formless countryside; the lace about her hair fluttered
      ceaselessly; and her wrap bellowed and clung about her shoulders, about
      her gloveless hands folded upon her slim knees. She was splendidly,
      regally scornful upon the wings of their reckless flight; the throttle was
      wide open; they swung from side to side, hung on a single wheel, lunged
      bodily into the air. In the mad ecstasy of speed she rose; but Anthony,
      clutching her arms, pulled her sharply into the seat. Then, decisively, he
      shut off the power, the world ceased to race behind them, the smooth
      clamor of the engine sank to a low vibratone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did that wonderfully,&rdquo; she told him with glowing cheeks, shining
      eyes; &ldquo;it was marvellous. A moment like that is worth a life-time on
      foot... laughing at death, at everything that is safe, admirable, moral...
      a moment of the freedom of soulless things, savage and unaccountable to
      God or society.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The illuminated face of the clock before him indicated a few minutes past
      one, and, tentatively, he repeated the time. &ldquo;How stupid of you,&rdquo; she
      protested; &ldquo;silly, little footrule of the hours, the conventional measure
      of the commonplace. For punishment&mdash;on and on. Like Columbus' men you
      are afraid of falling over the edge of&mdash;propriety.&rdquo; She turned to him
      with solemn eyes. &ldquo;I assure you there is no edge, no bump or brimstone, no
      place where good stops and tumbles into bad; it's all continuous&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He lost the thread of her mocking discourse, and glanced swiftly at her,
      his brow wrinkled, the shadow of a smile upon his lips. &ldquo;Heavens! but you
      are good-looking,&rdquo; she acknowledged, her countenance studiously critical,
      impersonal. After that silence once more fell upon them; the machine sang
      through the dark, lifting over ridges, dropping down declines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony had long since lost all sense of their position. The cyanite
      depths of the sky turned grey, cold; there was a feeling in the air of
      settling dew; a dank mist filled the hollows; the color seemed suddenly to
      have faded from the world. He felt unaccountably weary, inexpressibly
      depressed; he could almost taste the vapidity of further existence. Annoys
      hard, bright words echoed in his brain; the flame of his unthinking
      idealism sank in the thin atmosphere of their logic.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>HE had settled low
      in the seat, her mouth and chin hidden in the folds of the satin wrap; her
      face seemed as chill as marble, her youth cruel, disdainful. But her
      undeniable courage commanded his admiration, the unwavering gaze of her
      eyes into the dark. He wondered if, back of her crisp defenses, she were
      happy. He knew from observation that she led an almost isolated
      existence... she had gathered about her no circle of her own age, she
      indulged in none of the rapturous confidences, friendships, so sustaining
      to other girls. The peculiar necessities of her father had accomplished
      this. Yet he was aware that she cherished a general contempt for youth at
      large, for a majority of the grown, for that matter. Contempt colored her
      attitude to a large extent: that and happiness did not seem an orderly
      pair.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt, rather than saw, the influence of the dawn behind him; it was as
      though the grey air grew more transparent. Annot twisted about. &ldquo;Oh! turn,
      turn!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;the day! we are driving away from it.&rdquo; A sudden
      intoxicating freshness streamed like a sparkling birdsong over the world,
      and Anthony's dejection vanished with the gloom now at their backs.
      Delicate lavender shadows grew visible upon the grass, the color shifted
      tremulously, like the shot hues of changeable silks, until the sun poured
      its ore into the verdant crucible of the countryside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am most frightfully hungry,&rdquo; Annot admitted with that entire frankness
      which he found so refreshing. &ldquo;I wonder&mdash;&rdquo; On either hand fields, far
      farmhouses, reached unbroken to the horizon; before them the road rose
      between banks of soft, brown loam, apparently into the sky. But, beyond
      the rise, they came upon a roadside store, its silvery boards plastered
      with the garish advertisements of tobaccos, and a rickety porch, now
      undergoing a vigorous sweeping at the hands of an old man with insecure
      legs, upon whose faded personage was stamped unmistakably the initials &ldquo;G.
      A. R.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony brought the car to a halt, and returned his brisk and curious
      salutation. &ldquo;Shall I bring out some crackers?&rdquo; he asked from the road. But
      she elected to follow him into the store. The interior presented the usual
      confusion of gleaming tin and blue overalls, monumental cheeses and cards
      of buttons, a miscellany of ludicrously varied merchandise. Annot found a
      seat upon a splintered church pew, now utilized as a secular resting
      place, while Anthony foraged through the shelves. He returned with the
      crackers, and a gold lump of dates, upon which they breakfasted hugely.
      &ldquo;D'y like some milk?&rdquo; the aged attendant inquired, and forthwith dipped it
      out of a deep, cool and ringing can.
    </p>
    <p>
      Afterward they sat upon the step and smoked matutinal cigarettes. The day
      gathered in a shimmering haze above the vivid com, the emerald of the
      shorn fields; the birds had already subsided from the heat among the
      leaves. Anthony saw that the lamps of the car were still alight, a feeble
      yellow flicker, and turned them out. He tested the engine; and, finding it
      still running, turned with an unspoken query to Annot. She rose slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The wrap slipped from her bare shoulders and her dinner gown with its high
      sulphur girdle, the scrap of black lace about her hair, presented a
      strange, brilliantly artificial picture against the blistered, gaunt
      boards of the store, with, at its back, the open sunny space of pasture,
      wood and sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's barely twenty miles back,&rdquo; she told him, once more settled at his
      side. The old man regarded them from under one gnarled palm, the other
      tightly clasped about the broom handle; his jaw was dropped; incredulity,
      senile surprise, claimed him for their own.
    </p>
    <p>
      With Annot, Anthony reflected, he was everlastingly getting into new
      situations; she seemed to lift him out of the ordinary course of events
      into a perverse world of her own, a front-backward land where the
      unexpected, without rule or obligation, continually happened; and, what
      was strangest of all, without any of the dark consequences which he had
      been taught must inevitably follow such departures. He recalled the
      incredulous smiles, the knowing insinuations, that would have greeted the
      exact recounting of the past night at Doctor Allhop's drugstore. He would
      himself, in the past, have regarded such a tale as a flimsy fabrication.
      And suddenly he perceived dimly, in a mind unused to such abstractions,
      the veil of ugliness, of degradation, that hung so blackly about the
      thoughts of men. He gazed with a new sympathy and comprehension at the
      scornful line of Annot's vivid young lips; something of her superiority,
      her contempt, was communicated to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She became aware of his searching gaze, and smiled in an intimate,
      friendly fashion at him. &ldquo;You are the most comfortable person alive,&rdquo; she
      told him. There was nothing critical in her tones now. &ldquo;I said that you
      were not a good chauffeur, and&mdash;&rdquo; the surroundings grew familiar,
      they had nearly reached their destination, and an impalpable reserve fell
      upon her, but she continued to smile at him, &ldquo;and... you are not.&rdquo; That
      was the last word she addressed to him that day.
    </p>
    <p>
      As, later, he sluiced the automobile with water, he recalled the strange
      intimacy of the night, her warm and sympathetic voice; once she had
      steadied herself with a clinging hand upon his shoulder. These new
      attributes of the person who, shortly, passed him silently and with cold
      eyes, stirred his imagination; they were potent, rare, unsettling.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>otwithstanding, in
      the days which followed there was a perceptible change in Annot's attitude
      toward him: she became, as it were, conscious of his actuality. One
      afternoon she read aloud to him a richly-toned, gloomy tale of Africa.
      They were sitting by a long window, open, but screened from the summer
      heat by stiff, darkly-drooping green folds, where they could hear the drip
      of the fountain in its basin, a cool punctuation on the sultry page of the
      afternoon. Annot proceeded rapidly in an even, low voice; she was dressed
      in filmy lavender, with little buttons of golden velvet, an intricately
      carved gold buckle at her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony listened as closely as possible, the faint smile which seldom left
      him hovering over his lips. The bald action of the narrative&mdash;a
      running fight with ambushed savages from a little tin pot of a steamer, a
      mysterious affair in the darkness with a grim skeleton of a fellow, stakes
      which bore a gory fruitage of human heads, held him; but the rest...
      words, words. His attention wavered, fell upon minute, material objects;
      Annot's voice grew remote, returned, was lost among his juggling thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it splendid!&rdquo; she exclaimed, at last closing the volume; &ldquo;the most
      beautiful story of our time&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped abruptly, and cast a
      penetrating glance at him. &ldquo;I don't believe you even listened,&rdquo; she
      declared. &ldquo;In your heart you prefer, 'Tortured by the Tartars.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His smile broadened, including his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are impossible! No,&rdquo; she veered suddenly, &ldquo;you're not; if you cared
      for this you wouldn't be... you. That's the most important thing in the
      world. Besides, I wouldn't like you; everybody reads now, it's frightfully
      common; while you are truly indifferent. Have you noticed, my child, that
      books always increase where life runs thin? and you are alive, not a
      papier-mâché man painted in the latest shades.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony dwelt on this unexpected angle upon his mental delinquencies. The
      approval of Annot Hardinge, so critical, so outspoken, was not without an
      answering glow in his being; no one but she might discover his ignorance
      to be laudable.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose, and the book slipped neglected to the floor. &ldquo;The mirror of my
      dressing table is collapsing,&rdquo; she informed him; &ldquo;I wonder if you would
      look at it.&rdquo; He followed her above to her room; it was a large,
      four-square chamber, its windows brushed by the glossy leaves of an aged
      black-heart cherry tree. Her bed was small, with a counterpane of
      grotesque lace animals, a table held a scattered collection of costly
      trifles, and a closet door stood open upon a shimmering array from deepest
      orange to white and pale primrose. An enigmatic lacy garment, and a
      surprisingly long pair of black silk stockings, occupied a chair; while
      the table was covered with columns of print on long sheets of paper.
      &ldquo;Galleys,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;I read all father's proof.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He moved the dressing table from the wall, and discovered the bolt which
      had held the mirror in place upon the floor. As he screwed it into
      position, Annot said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't look around for a minute.&rdquo; There was a swift whisper of skirts, a
      pause, then, &ldquo;all right.&rdquo; He straightened up, and found that she had
      changed to a white skirt and waist. Fumbling in the closet she produced a
      pair of low, brown shoes, and kicking off her slippers, donned the others,
      balancing each in turn on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go&mdash;anywhere,&rdquo; she proposed; &ldquo;but principally where books are
      not and birds are.&rdquo; At a drugstore they purchased largely of licorice
      root, which they consumed sitting upon a fence without the town.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span> SAID that
      instinctively, back in my room,&rdquo; Annot remarked with a puzzled frown. &ldquo;It
      was beastly, really, to feel the necessity... as though we had something
      corrupt to hide. And I feel that you are especially nice&mdash;that way.
      You see, I am not trying to dispose of myself like the clever maidens at
      the balls and bazaars, my legs and shoulders are quite uncalculated. There
      is no price on... on my person; I'm not fishing for any nice little
      Christian ceremony. No man will have to pay the price of hats at Easter
      and furs in the fall, of eternal boredom, for me. All this stuff in the
      novels about the sacredness of love and constancy is just&mdash;stuff!
      Love isn't like that really; it's a natural force, and Nature is always
      practical: potato bugs and jimson-weed and men, it is the same law for all
      of them&mdash;more potato bugs, more men, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony grasped only the larger implications of this speech, its
      opposition to that love which he had felt as a misty sort of glory, as
      intangible as the farthest star, as fragrant as a rose in the fingers.
      There was an undeniable weight of solid sense in what Annot had said. She
      knew a great deal more than himself, more&mdash;yes&mdash;than Eliza, more
      than anybody he had before known; and, in the face of her overwhelmingly
      calm and superior knowledge, his vision of love as eternal, changeless,
      his ecstatic dreams of Eliza with the dim, magic white lilacs in her arms,
      grew uncertain, pale. Love, viewed with Annot's clear eyes, was a
      commonplace occurrence, and marriage the merest, material convenience:
      there was nothing sacred about it, or in anything&mdash;death, birth, or
      herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      And was not the biologist, with his rows of labelled plants and bones, his
      courageous questioning of the universe, of God Himself, bigger than the
      majority of men with their thin covering of cant, the hypocrisy in which
      they cloaked their doubts, their crooked politics and business? Rufus
      Hardinge's conception of things, Annot's reasoning and patent honesty,
      seemed more probable, more convincing, than the accepted romantic, often
      insincere, view of living, than the organ-roll and stained glass attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his new rationalism he eyed the world with gloomy prescience; he had
      within him the somber sense of slain illusions; all this, he felt, was
      proper to increasing years and experience; yet, between them, they emptied
      the notable bag of licorice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annot rested a firm palm upon his shoulder and sprang to the ground, and
      they walked directly and silently back. &ldquo;It's a mistake to discuss
      things,&rdquo; Annot discovered to him from the door of her room, &ldquo;they should
      be lived; thus Zarathustrina.&rdquo;

      white streamers and pennants by wind gusts, and entered through a long
      window a formal chamber seldom occupied. A thick, white carpet bore a
      scattered design in pink and china blue; oil paintings of the Dutch
      school, as smooth as ice, hung in massive gold frames; a Louis XVI clock,
      intricately carved and gilded, rested upon a stand enamelled in black and
      vermilion, inlaid with pagodas and fantastic mandarins in ebony and

      &ldquo;The line to the anterior-posterior diameter is simian,&rdquo; the biologist
      asserted. &ldquo;The cusps prove nothing, but that forward slope&mdash;&rdquo; he half
      rose from his chair, his eyes glittering wrathfully at Anthony, but fell
      back trembling... &ldquo;simian,&rdquo; he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A possible difference of millions of years in human history,&rdquo; Annot added
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But can't they agree at all!&rdquo; Anthony exclaimed; &ldquo;don't they know
      anything? That's an awful long time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A hundred million years,&rdquo; the elder interrupted with a contemptuous
      gesture, &ldquo;nothing, a moment. I place the final glacial two hundred and
      seventy million after Jenner, and we have&mdash;, agreed to dismiss it;
      trifling, adventitious. There are more fundamental discrepancies,&rdquo; he
      admitted. &ldquo;Unless something definite is discovered, a firm base
      established, a single ray of light let into a damnable dark,&rdquo; he stopped
      torn with febrile excitement, then, scarcely audible, continued, &ldquo;our
      lives, our work... will be of less account than the blood of Oadacer,
      spilt on barbaric battle-fields.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rain ceased as suddenly as it had begun. Anthony followed Annot to the
      porch. In the black spaces between the swiftly shifting clouds stars shone
      brilliantly; there was a faint drip from the trees. &ldquo;He gets dreadfully
      depressed,&rdquo; she interpreted her parent to him. &ldquo;They wrangle all the time,
      exactly like a lot of schoolgirls. You have no idea of the bitterness, the
      jealousy, the contemptuous personalities in the Quarterlies. Really, they
      are as fanatical, as narrow, as the churches they ignore; they are quite
      like Presbyterian biologists and Catholic.&rdquo; She sighed lightly. &ldquo;They
      leave little for a youngish person to dream on. You are so superior&mdash;to
      ignore these centessimo affairs. Will you lean from the edge of your cloud
      and smile on a daughter of the earth in last year's dinner gown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was, he told himself, nonsense; yet he was moved to make no easy reply,
      something in her voice, illusive and wistful, made that impossible. &ldquo;It's
      very good-looking,&rdquo; he said impotently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you like it,&rdquo; she told him simply. &ldquo;M'sieur Paret fitted it
      himself while an anteroom full of women hated me. Oh, Anthony!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;I'd love to wander with you down that brilliant street and
      through the Place Vendôme to the Seine. Better still&mdash;there's a
      little shop on the Via Cavour in Florence where they sell nothing but
      chocolate, chocolate, chocolate, the most heavenly cakes with black hearts
      and the most heavenly smell. And you'd like Spain, so fierce and hot
      against its dusty hills; and Cortina, green beneath its red mountains. We
      could get a porter and rucksacks, and walk&mdash;&rdquo; she broke off, her
      hands pressed to her cheeks, a dawning dismay in her eyes. Then she was
      gone with a flutter of the skirt so carefully draped by M'sieur Paret.

      places had stirred him but slightly: but to travel with Annot, to see
      anything with Annot, would offer continual amusement and surprise; her
      vigorous candor, her freedom from sham and petty considerations, enveloped
      the most commonplace perspectives in an atmosphere of high novelty. The
      trace of the vagabond, the detachment of the born dweller in tents, woven
      so picturesquely through his being, responded to her careless indifference
      to the tyranny of an established and timid scheme of existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following day her old, bright hardness had returned: she railed at him
      in French, in German, in Italian; she called him the solemn shover, Sir
      Anthony Absolute. And, holding Thomas Huxley's head directed toward him,
      recommended that resigned quadruped to emulate Anthony's austere and

      trace of gayety in the excited and subdued tones in which, later, she
      called him into the hothouse. He found her bending tense with emotion over
      the row of plants upon whose flowering such incalculable things depended.
      &ldquo;Look!&rdquo; she cried, taking his hand and drawing him down over the green
      shoots, where his cheek brushed her hair, where he felt the warm stir of
      her breathing. &ldquo;Look! they are in full bud, to-morrow they will burst
      open.&rdquo; She straightened up, his hand still held in hers, and a shadow fell
      upon her vivid countenance. &ldquo;If his reasoning is wrong, this experiment...
      like all the others, it will kill him. They <i>must</i> be white, it would
      be too cruel, too senseless not. I am afraid,&rdquo; she said simply; &ldquo;nature is
      so terrible, a Juggernaut, crushing everything to dust beneath its
      wheeling centuries. I am glad that you are here, Anthony.&rdquo; She drew closer
      to him; her breast swelled in a sharp, tempestuous breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have been lonelier than I&mdash;I realized. I am dreadfully worried
      about father. They have lied to me; things are worse, I can see that. You
      have to dress him like a child; I know how considerate you are; you are
      bright, new gold with the clearest ring in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must get a real chauffeur; you have never been that... in my thoughts.
      You know,&rdquo; she laughed happily, &ldquo;I said in the beginning that you were a
      miserable affair in details of that kind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A feeling of guilt rose swiftly within him, which, unwilling to
      acknowledge, he strove to beat down from his thoughts. But, above his
      endeavor, grew the clear conviction that he should immediately tell Annot
      his purpose in driving Rufus Hardinge's car. He must not victimize her
      generosity, nor take profit from the friendship she offered him so
      unreservedly. He was dimly conscious that the revelation of his design
      would end the pleasant intimacy growing up between them; the mere mention
      of Eliza must destroy their happy relations; girls, even Annot, were like
      that.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wondered, suddenly cold, if this spelled disloyalty to Eliza! but he
      angrily refuted that whispered insinuation. His love for Eliza was as
      un-assailably above all other considerations as she herself shone starlike
      over a petty, stumbling humanity. White and withdrawn and fine she
      inhabited the skies of his aspirations. He endeavored now to capture her
      in his imagination, his memory; and she smiled at him palely, as from a
      very great distance. He realized that in the past few days he had not had
      that subtle sense of her nearness, he had not been conscious of that
      drifting odor of lilacs; and suddenly he felt impoverished, alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Annot smiled, warm and near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are awfully kind,&rdquo; he temporized; &ldquo;but hadn't we better let the thing
      stand as it is? You see&mdash;I want money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you may have that now; whatever you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. You are so good, it's hard to explain&mdash;I want money that I earn;
      real money; I couldn't think of taking any other from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anthony, my good bourgeois! I had thought you quite without that sort of
      tin pride. Besides, I am not giving it to you; after all it's father's to
      use as he likes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I must give him something for it&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose you are giving us nothing?&rdquo; she interrupted him warmly;
      &ldquo;you have brought us your clear, beautiful spirits, absolutely without
      price. Why, you can make father laugh; have you any idea how rarely he did
      that? When you imitate Margaret absolutely I can see her fat, white
      stockings. And your marvellous unworldliness&mdash;&rdquo; she shook her head
      mournfully. &ldquo;I fear that this is mere calculation; surely you must know
      the value of your innocent charms.&rdquo; Anthony stood with a lowered head,
      floundering mentally among his warring inclinations; when, almost with
      relief, he saw that she had noiselessly vanished.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E slept uneasily,
      and woke abruptly to a room flooded with sunlight, and an unaccountable
      sense of something gone wrong. He dressed hurriedly, and had opened his
      door, when he heard his name called from below. It was Annot, he knew, but
      her voice was strange, terrified&mdash;a helpless cry new to her
      accustomed poise. &ldquo;Anthony! Anthony!&rdquo; she called from the conservatory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus Hardinge, who, it was evident from his clothes had not been in bed,
      was standing rigidly before the row of plants upon whose flowering they
      had so intently waited. And, in a rapid glance, Anthony saw that they had
      blossomed in delicate, parti-colored petals&mdash;some pale lavender,
      others deep purple, still others reddish white. Annoys yellow wrap was
      thrown carelessly about her nightgown, her feet were bare, and her hair
      hung in a tangle about her blanched face.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Anthony entered she clung to his arm, and he saw that she was
      trembling violently. For a tense moment they were silent: the sun streamed
      over the mathematical plant ranks and lit the white or blue tickets tied
      to their stems; a bubbling chorus of birds filled the world of leaves
      without. &ldquo;It's all wrong,&rdquo; she sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So!&rdquo; the biologist finally said with a wry smile; &ldquo;you see that I have
      not solved the riddle of the universe; inheritance in pure line is not
      explicated.... A life of labor as void as any prostitute's; not a single
      fact, not a supposition warranted, not a foot advanced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a sudden and violent movement for which they were entirely unprepared
      he swept the row of plants crashing upon the floor; where, in a scattered
      heap of brown loam, broken pottery, smeared bloom, their tenuous, pallid
      roots quivered in air. &ldquo;Games with plants and animals and bones for
      elderly children; riddles without answer... blind ways.&rdquo; His expression
      grew furtive, cunning. &ldquo;I have been trifled with,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I have
      been deliberately misled; but I desire to say that I see through&mdash;through
      Him: I comprehend His little joke. It's in bad taste... to leave a soul in
      the dark, blundering about in the cellar with the table spread above. But
      in the end I was not completely bamboozled. He was not quick enough... the
      hem of His garment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother saw Him clear. She was considered beautiful, but beauty's a
      vague term. Perhaps if I saw her now it would be clearer to me. But I'll
      tell you His little joke,&rdquo; he lowered his voice confidentially&mdash;&ldquo;it's
      all true&mdash;that apocalyptical heaven; there's a big book, trumpets,
      angels all complete singing Gregorian chants. What a sell!&rdquo; He laughed, a
      gritty, mirthless performance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come up to your room, father,&rdquo; Annot urged; &ldquo;his arm, Anthony.&rdquo; Anthony
      placed his hand gently upon the biologist's shoulder, but the latter
      wrenched himself free. Suddenly with a choked cry and arms swinging like
      flails he launched himself upon the orderly plants. Before he could be
      stopped row upon row splintered on the floor; he fought, struggled with
      them as though they were animate opponents, cursed them in a high, raving
      voice. Anthony quickly lifted him, pinning his arms to his sides. Annot
      had turned away, her shoulders shaking with sobs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rufus Hardinge's struggling unexpectedly ceased, his countenance regained
      completely its habitual quietude. &ldquo;I shall begin once more, at the
      beginning,&rdquo; he whispered infinitely wistful. &ldquo;The little ray of light...
      germ of understanding. The scientific problem of the future,&rdquo; his speech
      became labored, thick, &ldquo;scientific... future. Other avenue of progress:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen, the Royal Society, a paper on, on&mdash;Tears, gentlemen...
      not only automatic,&rdquo; his voice sank to a mere incomprehensible babble.
      Anthony carried him to his bed, while Annot telephoned for the
      neurologist.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the specialist had gone Annot came in to where Anthony waited in the
      study. Her feet were thrust in the Turkish slippers, her hair twisted into
      a hasty knot, but otherwise she had not changed. She came swiftly, with
      pale lips and eyes brilliantly shining from dark hollows, to his side.
      &ldquo;His wonderful brain is dead,&rdquo; she told him. &ldquo;Professor Jamison thinks
      there will be only a few empty years to the end. But actually it's all
      over.&rdquo; In a manner utterly incomprehensible to him she was crying softly
      in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      He must lead her to a chair, he told himself, release her at once. Yet she
      remained with her warm, young body pressed against him, the circle of her
      arms about his neck, her tears wet upon his cheek. He stepped back, but
      she would have fallen if he had not continued to support her. His brain
      whirled under the assault, the surrender, of her dynamic youth. Their
      mouths met; were bruised in kissing.

      shoulders, twisting lips; and, after a momentary pause, she fled from the
      room. Cold waves of self-hatred flowed over him&mdash;he had taken a
      despicable advantage of her grief. The pleasant fabric of the past,
      unthinking days, the new materialism with its comfortable freedom from
      restraint, crumbled from an old, old skeleton whose moldering lines
      spelled the death of all&mdash;his heart knew&mdash;that was high,
      desirable, immaculate. He wondered if, like Rufus Hardinge, his
      understanding had come too late. But, in the re-surge of his adoration for
      Eliza, infinitely more beautiful and serene from the pit out of which he
      sped his vision, he was possessed by the conviction that nothing created
      nor void should extinguish the bright flame of his passion, hold them
      separate.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the midst of his turmoil he recalled Eliza with relief, with delight,
      with tumultuous longing. He soared on the wings of his ecstasy; but
      descended abruptly to the practical necessities which confronted him. He
      must leave the Hardinges immediately; with a swift touch of the humorous
      spirit native to him, he realized that again he would be without money.
      Then more seriously he considered his coming interview with Annot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was charged with the vague unrest, the strange aspect of
      familiar things, wrought by serious illness. Luncheon was disorganized,
      Annot was late. She was pale, but, under an obvious concern, she radiated
      a suppressed content. She laid a letter before Anthony. &ldquo;Registered,&rdquo; she
      told him. &ldquo;I signed.&rdquo; It was, he saw, from his father, and he slipped it
      into his pocket, intent upon the explanation which lay before him. It
      would be more difficult even than he had anticipated: Annot spoke of the
      near prospect of a Mediterranean trip, if Rufus Hardinge rallied
      sufficiently. &ldquo;He is as contented and gentle as a nice old lady,&rdquo; she
      reported; then, with a subtle expansion of manner, &ldquo;it will be such fun&mdash;I
      shall take you by the hand, 'This, my good infant, is one of Virgil's
      final resting places....'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That would be splendid,&rdquo; he acknowledged, &ldquo;but I'm afraid that I sha'n't
      be able to go. The fact is that&mdash;that I had better leave you. I can't
      take your money for... for....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him swiftly, under the shadow of a frown, then shook her
      head at him. &ldquo;That tiresome money again! It's a strange thing for you to
      insist on; material considerations are ordinarily as far as possible from
      your thoughts. I forbid you absolutely to mention it again; every time you
      do I shall punish you&mdash;I shall present you with a humiliating gold
      piece in person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be all kinds of a trimmer to take advantage of your goodness.
      No, I must go&mdash;&rdquo; The gay warmth evaporated from her countenance as
      abruptly as though it had been congealed in a sudden icy breath; she sat
      motionless, upright, enveloping him in the bright resentment of her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I must ask you to forgive me for... for this morning,&rdquo; he stumbled
      hastily on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The resentment burned into a clear flame of angry contempt. &ldquo;'For this
      morning!' because I kissed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He made a vehement gesture of denial. &ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; But she would not allow
      him to finish. &ldquo;But I did,&rdquo; she announced in a hard, determined voice. &ldquo;It
      isn't necessary for you to be polite; I don't care a damn for that
      sickening sort of thing. I did, and you are properly and modestly
      retreating. I believe that you think I am&mdash;'designing,' isn't that
      the word? that you might have to marry me. A kiss, I am to realize, is
      something sacred. Bah! you make me ill, like almost everything else in
      life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you think for a minute that it was anything more than the expression
      of a passing impulse you are beyond words. And, if it had been more, you&mdash;you
      violet, I wouldn't marry you; I wouldn't marry any man, ever! ever! ever!
      I might have gone to Italy with you, but probably come home with some one
      else&mdash;will that get into your pretty prejudices?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you had gone to Italy with me,&rdquo; he declared sullenly, &ldquo;you would never
      have come home with anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sort of thing has been dismissed to the smaller rural towns and the
      cheap melodramas; it's no longer considered elevated to talk like that,
      but only pitiful. You will start next on 'God's noblest creation,' and
      purity, and the females of your family. Don't you know, haven't you been
      told, that the primitive religious rubbish about marriage has been laughed
      out of existence? Did you dream that I wanted to <i>keep</i> you? or that
      I would allow you to keep me after the thing had got stale? It makes me
      cold all over to be so frightfully misunderstood. Oh, its unthinkable! Fi,
      to kiss you! wasn't it loose of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her contemptuous periods stung him in a thousand minute places. &ldquo;I told
      you,&rdquo; he retorted hotly, &ldquo;that I wanted to make money; I don't want it
      given to me; it's for my wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, how stupid of me not to have guessed&mdash;the lips sacred to
      her,&rdquo; her own trembled ever so slightly, but her scornful attitude, her
      direct, bright gaze, were maintained, &ldquo;A knight errant adventuring for a
      village queen with her handkerchief in his sleeve and tempted by the
      inevitable Kundry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He settled himself to weathering this feminine storm; he owed her all the
      relief to be found in words. &ldquo;I wanted the money to go West,&rdquo; he
      particularized further. &ldquo;There's a position waiting for me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all very chaste,&rdquo; she told him, &ldquo;but terribly commonplace. I think
      that I don't care to hear the details.&rdquo; She addressed herself to what
      remained of the luncheon. &ldquo;Have some more sauce,&rdquo; she advised coolly, then
      rang. &ldquo;The pudding, Jane,&rdquo; she directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have been wonderfully kind&mdash;&rdquo; he began. But she halted him
      abruptly. &ldquo;We'll drop all that,&rdquo; she pronounced, and deliberately lit a
      cigarette.
    </p>
    <p>
      A genuine admiration for her possessed Anthony; he recognized that she was
      extraordinarily good to look at; he had had no idea that so vigorous a
      spirit could have burned behind a becoming dress by Paret. He realized
      with a faint regret, eminently masculine, that other men, men of moment,
      would find her irresistibly attractive. Already it seemed incredible that
      she had ever been familiar, intimate, tender, with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be wanting to leave,&rdquo; she said, rising; &ldquo;&mdash;whenever you
      like. I have written for a&mdash;a chauffeur. I think you should have,

      &ldquo;Not twenty-five cents,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't like to force your delicate sensibilities.&rdquo; She left the
      room. He caught a last glimpse of her firm, young profile; her shining,
      coppery hair; her supple, upright carriage.

      assembled the battered clothing in which Rufus Hardinge had discovered
      him, preparatory to changing from his present more elaborate garb, but a
      sudden realization of the triviality of that course, born of the memory of
      Annot's broad disposition, halted him midway. Making a hasty bundle of his
      personal belongings he descended from the tower room. Through an open door
      he could see the still, white face of the biologist looming from a pillow,
      and the trim form of a nurse.

    <p>
      Thomas Huxley lay somnolently on the porch, beside Annot's coffee-colored
      wicker chair and a yellow paper book which bore a title in French. He
      paused on the street, gazing back, and recalled his first view of the
      four-square, ugly house in its coat of mustard-colored paint, the grey,
      dripping cupids of the fountain, the unknown girl with yellow silk
      stockings. Already he seemed to have crossed the gulf which divided it all
      from the present: its significance faded, its solidity dissolved, dropped
      behind, like a scene viewed from a car window. He turned, obsessed by the
      old, familiar impatience to hurry forward, the feeling that all time, all
      energy, all plans and thoughts, were vain that did not lead directly to&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden and unaccountable sensation of cold swept over him, a profound
      emotion stirring in response to an obscure, a hidden cause. Then, with a
      rush, returned the feeling of Eliza's nearness: he <i>heard</i> her, the
      little, indefinable noises of her moving; he felt the unmistakable thrill
      which she alone brought. There was a vivid sense of her hand hovering
      above his shoulder; her fingers <i>must</i> descend, rest warmly.... God!
      how did she get here. He whirled about... nothing against the low
      stone-wall that bounded a sleepy garden, nothing in the paved perspective
      of the sunny street! He stood shaken, half terrified, miserable. He had
      never felt her nearness so poignantly; her distant potency had never
      before so mocked his hungering nerves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, with the cold chilling him like a breath from an icy vault, he heard
      her, beyond all question, beyond all doubt:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anthony!&rdquo; she called. &ldquo;Anthony!&rdquo; From somewhere ahead of him her tones
      sounded thin and clear; they seemed to reach him dropping from a window,
      lingering, neither grave nor gay, but tenderly secure, upon his hearing.
      He broke into a clattering run over the bricks of the unremarkable street,
      but soon slowed awkwardly into a walk, jeering at his fancy, his laboring
      heart, his mad credulity. And then, drifting across his bewildered senses,
      came the illusive, the penetrating, the remembered odor of lilacs, like a
      whisper, a promise, a magic caress.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was with a
      puzzled frown that Anthony halted in the heart of the city and considered
      his present resources, his future, possible plans. He had three dollars
      and some small silver left from the Hardinges, and he regarded with
      skepticism the profession of chauffeur; he would rather adventure the
      heavier work of the garages. As the afternoon was far advanced he decided
      to defer his search until the following morning; and he was absorbed
      within the gaudy maw of a moving picture theater.
    </p>
    <p>
      Later, he entered an elaborate maze of mirrors, where, apparently, a sheaf
      of Susannas unconsciously exhibited their diminishing, anatomical charms
      to a procession of elders advancing two by two through a perspective of
      sycamores.&mdash;At the bar, his glass of beer supported by two fried
      oysters, a sandwich and a saucer of salted almonds, he reflected upon the
      slough of sterility that had fastened upon his feet: something must be
      accomplished, decisive, immediate.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was proceeding toward the entrance when the familiar aspect of a back
      brought him to a halt. The back moved, turned, and resolved into the
      features of Thomas Addington Meredith. The mutual, surprised recognition
      was followed by a greeting of friendly slaps, queries, the necessity for
      instant, additional beers, and they found a place at a small, polished
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was surprised to discover Tom Meredith the same foxy-faced boy he had
      left in Doctor Allhop's drugstore... it seemed to Anthony that an
      incalculable time had passed since the breaking of the bottles of perfume;
      he felt himself to be infinitely changed, older, and the other his junior
      by decades of experience and a vast accumulation of worldly knowledge,
      contact with men, women, and events. Tom's raiment did not seem so
      princely as it had aforetime; the ruby reputed to be the gift of a married
      woman, was obviously meretricious, the gold timepiece merely commonplace.
      But Anthony was unaffectedly glad to see him, to discuss homely, familiar
      topics, repeat affectionately the names of favorite localities, persons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm in a bonding house here,&rdquo; Tom explained upon Anthony's query.
      &ldquo;Nothing in Ellerton for <i>me</i>. What are you doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, until to-morrow, when I think I'll get something in one of the
      garages.&rdquo; He thrust his hands negligently into his pockets, and came in
      contact with his father's forgotten letter. He opened it, gazing curiously
      at the words: &ldquo;My dear Son,&rdquo; when Tom, with an exclamation, bent and
      recovered a piece of yellow paper that had fallen from the envelope. &ldquo;Is
      this all you think of these?&rdquo; he demanded, placing a fifty dollar bill
      upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony read the letter with growing incredulous wonder and joy. He looked
      up with burning cheeks at his companion. &ldquo;Remember old Mrs. Bosbyshell?&rdquo;
       he questioned in an eager voice. &ldquo;I used to carry wood, do odd jobs, for
      her: well, she's dead, and left me&mdash;what do you think!&mdash;father
      says about forty-seven thousand dollars. It's there, waiting for me, in
      Ellerton.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he forgot Thomas Meredith, the glittering saloon, the diminishing
      perspective of Susannas&mdash;he saw Eliza smiling at him out of the dusk,
      with her arms full of white lilacs. With an unsteady pounding of his
      heart, a tightening of the throat, he realized that, miraculously, the
      happiness which he had imagined so far removed in the uncertain future had
      been brought to him now, to the immediate present. He could take a train
      at once and go to her. The waiting was over. The immeasurable joy that
      flooded him deepened to a great chord of happiness that vibrated highly
      through him. He folded the letter gravely, thoughtfully. It was but a few
      hours to Ellerton by train, he knew, but he doubted the possibility of a
      night connection to that sequestered town. He would go in the morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thomas,&rdquo; he declared, &ldquo;I am about to purchase you the best dinner that
      champagne can shoot into your debased middle. Oh, no, not here, but in a
      real place where you can catch your own fish and shoot a pheasant out of a
      painted tree.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus pleasantly apostrophized that individual led Anthony to the Della
      Robbia room of an elaborate hostelry, where they studied the <i>carte de
      jour</i> amid pink tiling and porphyry. There was a rosy flush of shaded
      lights over snowy linen in the long, high chamber, the subdued passage of
      waiters like silhouettes, low laughter, and a throbbing strain of violins
      falling from a balcony above their heads. They pondered nonchalantly the
      strange names, elaborate sauces; but were finally launched upon suave
      cocktails and clams. Anthony settled back into a glow of well-being, of
      the tranquillity that precedes an expected, secure joy. He saluted the
      champagne bucket by the table; when, suddenly, the necessity to speak of
      Eliza overcame him, he wished to hear her name pronounced by other lips...
      perhaps he would tell Tom all; he was the best of fellows....
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the Dreens home?&rdquo; he asked negligently. &ldquo;Have you seen Eliza Dreen
      about&mdash;you know with that soft, shiny hair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thomas Meredith directed at him a glance of careless surprise. &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he
      answered, &ldquo;I thought you knew; it seemed to me she died before you left.
      Anyhow, it was about the same time, it must have been the next week.
      Pneumonia. This soup's great, Anthony.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>E joy that had
      sung through Anthony shrunk into an intolerable pain like an icicle thrust
      into his heart; he swallowed convulsively a spoonful of soup, tasteless,
      scalding hot, and put the spoon down with a clatter. He half rose from the
      chair, with his arms extended, as if by that means he could ward off the
      terrible misfortune that had befallen him. Thomas Meredith, unaware of
      Anthony's drawn face, his staring gaze, continued to eat with gusto the
      unspeakable liquid, and the waiter uncorked the champagne with a soft
      explosion. The wine flowed bubbling into their glasses, and Tom held his
      aloft. &ldquo;To your good luck,&rdquo; he proclaimed, but set it down untouched at
      Anthony's pallor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter&mdash;sick? It's the beer and cocktail, it always does
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's not that,&rdquo; Anthony said very distinctly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice sounded to him like that of a third person. He was laboring to
      adjust the tumult within him to the fact of Eliza's death; he repeated
      half aloud the term &ldquo;dead&rdquo; and its whispered syllable seemed to fill the
      entire world, the sky, to echo ceaselessly in space. From the stringed
      instruments above came the refrain of a popular song; and, subconsciously,
      mechanically, he repeated the words aloud; when he heard his own voice he
      stopped as though a palm had been clapped upon his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Tom persisted; &ldquo;don't discompose this historical banquet.&rdquo;
       The waiter replaced the soup with fish, over which he spread a thick,
      yellow sauce. &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Anthony articulated, &ldquo;go on&mdash;&rdquo; he emptied his
      champagne glass at a gulp, and then a second. &ldquo;Certainly a fresh quart,&rdquo;
       his companion directed the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza was dead! pneumonia. That, he told himself, was why she had not
      answered his letter, why, on the steps at Hydrangea House, Mrs. Dreen&mdash;hell!
      how could he think of such things? Eliza... dead, cold who warm had kissed
      him; Eliza, for whom all had been dreamed, planned, undertaken, dead;
      Eliza gone from him, gone out of the sun into the damned and horrible
      dirt. Tom, explaining him satisfactorily, devoted himself to the
      succession of dishes that flowed through the waiter's skillful hands,
      dishes that Anthony dimly recognized having ordered&mdash;surely years
      before. &ldquo;You're drunk,&rdquo; Thomas declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drank inordinately: gradually a haze enveloped him, separating him from
      the world, from his companion, a shadowy shape performing strange antics
      at a distance. Sounds, voices, penetrated to his isolation, rent thinly
      the veil that held at its center the sharp pain dulled, expanded, into a
      leaden, sickening ache. He placed the yellow bank note on a silver platter
      that swayed before him, and in return received a crisp pile, which, with
      numb fingers, he crowded into a pocket. He would have fallen as he rose
      from his chair if Tom had not caught him, leading him stumbling but safely
      to the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't start an ugly drunk,&rdquo; Thomas Meredith begged. Without a word,
      Anthony turned and, with stiff legs, strode into the night. Eliza was
      dead; he had had something to give her, a surprise, but it was too late. A
      great piece of good fortune had overtaken him, he wanted to tell Eliza,
      but... he collided with a pedestrian, and continued at a tangent like a
      mechanical toy turned from its course. His companion swung him from under
      the wheels of a truck. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he panted, &ldquo;I'm no Marathon runner, it's
      hotter'n Egypt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The perspiration dripped from Anthony's countenance, wet the clenched
      palms of his hands. He walked on and on, through streets brilliantly
      lighted and streets dark; streets crowded with men in evening clothes,
      loafing with cigarettes by illuminated playbills, streets empty, silent
      save for the echo of his hurried, shambling footsteps. Eliza was lost, out
      there somewhere in the night; he must find her, bring her back: but he
      couldn't find her, nor bring her back&mdash;she was dead. He stopped to
      reconsider dully that idea. A row of surprisingly white marble steps, of
      closed doors, blank windows, confronted him. &ldquo;This is where I retire,&rdquo;
       Thomas Meredith declared. Anthony wondered what the fellow was buzzing
      about? why should he wait for him, Anthony Ball, at &ldquo;McCanns&rdquo;?
    </p>
    <p>
      He considered with a troubled brow a world empty of Eliza; it wasn't
      possible, no such foolish world could exist for a moment. Who had dared to
      rob him? In a methodical voice he cursed all the holy, all the august, all
      the reverent names he could call to mind. Then again he hurried on,
      leaving standing a ridiculous figure who shouted an incomprehensible
      sentence.
    </p>
    <p>
      He passed through an unsubstantial city of shadows, of sudden, clangoring
      sounds, of the blur of lights swaying in strings above his head, of
      unsteady luminous bubbles floating before him through ravines of gloom;
      bells rang loud and threatening, throats of brass bellowed. His head began
      to throb with a sudden pain, and the pain printed clearly on the bright
      suffering of his mind a stooping, dusty figure; leaden eyes, a grey face,
      peered into his own; slack lips mumbled the story of a boy dead long ago&mdash;Eliza,
      Eliza was dead&mdash;and of a red necktie, a Sunday suit; a fearful
      figure, a fearful story, from the low mutter of which he precipitantly
      fled. Other faces crowded his brain&mdash;Ellie with her cool,
      understanding look, his mother, his father frowning at him in assumed
      severity; he saw Mrs. Dreen, palely sweet in a starlit gloom. Then panic
      swept over him as he realized that he was unable, in a sudden freak of
      memory, to summon into that intimate gallery the countenance of Eliza. It
      was as though in disappearing from the corporeal world she had also
      vanished from the realm of his thoughts, of his longing. He paused,
      driving his nails into his palms, knotting his brow, in an agony of effort
      to visualize her. In vain. &ldquo;I can't remember her,&rdquo; he told an indistinct
      human form before him. &ldquo;I can't remember her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A voice answered him, thin and surprisingly bitter. &ldquo;When you are sober
      you will stop trying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And then he saw her once more, so vivid, so near, that he gave a sobbing
      exclamation of relief. &ldquo;Don't,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;not... lose again&mdash;&rdquo;
       He forgot for the moment that she was dead, and put out a hand to touch
      her. Thin air. Then he recalled. He commenced his direct, aimless course,
      but a staggering weariness overcame him, the toylike progress grew slower,
      there were interruptions, convulsive starts.

      the haze lightened about him: he saw clearly his surroundings, the black,
      glittering windows of stores, the gleaming rails which bound the stone
      street. His hat was gone and he had long before lost the bundle that
      contained his linen. But the loss was of small moment now&mdash;he had
      money, a pocketful of it, and forty-seven thousand dollars waiting in
      Ellerton: his father was a scrupulous, truthful and exact man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eliza and he would have been immediately married, gone to a little green
      village, under a red mountain; Eliza would have worn the most beautiful
      dresses made by a parrot; but that, he recognized shrewdly, was an idiotic
      fancy&mdash;birds didn't make dresses. And now she was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered a place of multitudinous mirrors reflecting a woman's
      flickering limbs, sly and bearded masculine faces, that somehow were
      vaguely familiar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Champagne!&rdquo; he cried, against the bar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your champagne'll come across in a schooner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But, impatiently, he shoved a handful of money into the zinc gutter.
      &ldquo;Champagne!&rdquo; he reiterated thickly. The barkeeper deduced four dollars and
      returned the balance. &ldquo;Sink it,&rdquo; he advised, &ldquo;or you'll get it lifted on
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With the wine, the mist deepened once more about him; the ache&mdash;was
      it in his head or his heart?&mdash;grew duller. He had poured out a third
      glass when a hand was laid upon his shoulder, and whirling suspiciously,
      he saw a uniform cap, a man's gaunt face and burning eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother,&rdquo; the latter said, &ldquo;brother, shall we leave this reeking sink,
      and go out together into God's night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Blinking, Anthony recognized the livery, the accents, of the Salvation
      Army. A sullen anger burned within him&mdash;this man was a sort of
      official connection of God's, who had killed Eliza. He smoothed out his
      face cunningly, moved obediently toward the other, and struck him
      viciously across the face. Pandemonium rose instantly about him, an
      incredible number of men appeared shouting, gesticulating, and formed in a
      ring of blurred, grinning faces. The jaw of the Salvation Army man was
      bright with blood, dark drops fell on his threadbare coat. His hand closed
      again on Anthony's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strive, brother,&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;The Mansion door is open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anthony regarded him with insolent disdain. &ldquo;Ought to be exposed,&rdquo; he
      articulated, &ldquo;whole thing... humbug. Isn't any such&mdash;such... Eliza's
      dead, ain't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A ripple of merriment ran about the circle of loose, stained lips; the
      curious, ribald eyes glittered with cold mirth; the circle flattened with
      the pressure of those without, impatient for a better view. Anthony
      surveyed them with impotent fury, loathing, and they met his passionate
      anger with faces as stony, as inhuman, as cruel, carved masks. He heard <i>her</i>
      name, the name of the gracious and beautiful vision of his adoration,
      repeated in hoarse, in maculate, in gibing tones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's dead,&rdquo; he repeated sharply, as though that fact should impose
      silence on them; &ldquo;you filthy curs!&rdquo; But their approbation of the spectacle
      became only the more marked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Salvation Army man fastened his hectic gaze upon Anthony; he was, it
      was evident, unaware of the blood drying upon his face, of the throng
      about them. &ldquo;There is no death,&rdquo; he proclaimed. &ldquo;There is no death!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she <i>is</i> dead,&rdquo; Anthony insisted; &ldquo;pneumonia... with green eyes
      and foggy hands.&rdquo; They began an insane argument: Eliza was gone, Anthony
      reiterated, the other could not deny that she was lost to life, to the
      sun. He recalled statements of Rufus Hardinge's, crisp iconoclasms of
      Annot's, and fitted them into the patchwork of his labored speech. Texts
      were flung aloft like flags by the other; ringing sentences in the
      incomparable English of King James echoed about the walls, the bottles of
      the saloon and beat upon the throng, the blank hearts, the beery brains,
      of the spectators. &ldquo;Blessed are the pure in heart,&rdquo; he orated, &ldquo;for
      they... for they...&rdquo;

      questioning him. The term became inexplicably merged with Eliza into one
      shining whole&mdash;Eliza, purity; purity, Eliza. A swift impression of
      massed, white flowers swept before him, leaving a delicate and trailing
      fragrance. He had a vision of purity as something concrete, something
      which, like a priceless and fragile vase, he guarded in his hands. It had
      been a charge from her, a trust that he must keep unspotted, inviolable,
      that she would require&mdash;but she was gone, she was dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;... through the valley of the shadow,&rdquo; the other cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had left him; he stood alone, guarding a meaningless thing, useless as
      the money in his pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man with bare, corded arms and an apron, broke roughly through the
      circle; and with a hand on Anthony's back, a hand on the back of his
      opponent, urged them toward the door. &ldquo;You'll have to take this outside,&rdquo;
       he pronounced, &ldquo;you're blocking the bar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An arm linked within Anthony's, and swung him aside. &ldquo;Unavoidably detained
      by merest 'quaintance,&rdquo; Thomas Meredith explained with ponderous
      exactitude. Unobserved, they found a place at the table they had occupied
      earlier in the evening. The latter ordered a fresh bottle, but was
      persuaded by Anthony to surrender the check which accompanied it.
    </p>
    <p>
      A sudden hatred for the money that had come too late possessed him: if he
      had had the whole forty-seven thousand dollars there he would have torn it
      up, trampled upon it, flung it to the noisome corners of the saloon. It
      seemed to have become his for the express purpose of mocking at his
      sorrow, his loss. His hatred spread to include that purity, that virtue,
      which he had conceived of as something material, an actual possession....
      That, at any rate, he might trample under foot, destroy, when and as it
      pleased him. Eliza was gone and all that was left was valueless. It had
      been, all unconsciously, dedicated to her; and now he desired to cast it
      into the mold that held her.
    </p>
    <p>
      He fingered with a new care the sum in his pocket, an admirably
      comprehensive plan had occurred to him&mdash;he would bury them both, the
      money and purity, beneath the same indignity. Tom Meredith, he was
      certain, could direct his purpose to its fulfillment. Nor was he mistaken.
      The conversation almost immediately swung to the subject of girls, girls
      gracious, prodigal of their charms. They would sally forth presently and
      &ldquo;see the town.&rdquo; Tom loudly asseverated his knowledge of all the inmates of
      all the complacent quarters under the gas light. Before a cab was summoned
      Anthony stumbled mysteriously to the bar, returning with a square,
      paper-wrapped parcel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Port wine,&rdquo; he ejaculated, &ldquo;must have it... for a good time.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> SEEMINGLY
      interminable ride followed, they rattled over rough stones, rolled with a
      clacking tire over asphalt. A smell unnamable, fulsome, corrupt, hung in
      Anthony's nostrils; the driver objurgated his horse in a desperate
      whisper; Tom's head fell from side to side on his breast. The mists surged
      about Anthony, veiling, obscuring all but the sullen purpose compressing
      his heart, throbbing in his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a halt, a rocking pavement and unctuous tones. Then a hall, a
      room, and the tinny racket of a piano, feminine voices that, at the same
      time, were hoarsely sexless, empty, like harsh echoes flung from a rocky
      void. A form in red silk took possession of Anthony's hand, sat by his
      side; a hot breath, a whisper, flattened against his ear. At times he
      could distinguish Tom's accents; he seemed to be arguing masterfully, but
      a shrill, voluble stream kept pace with him, silenced him in the end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony strove against great, inimical forces to maintain his sanity of
      action, ensure his purpose: he sat with a grim, haggard face as rigid as
      wood, as tense as metal. The cloudy darkness swept over him, impenetrable,
      appalling; through it he seemed to drop for miles, for years, for
      centuries; it lightened, and he found himself clutching the sides of his
      chair, shuddering over the space which, he had felt, gaped beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      In moments of respite he saw, gliding through the heated glare, gaily-clad
      forms; they danced; yet for all the dancing, for all the colors, they were
      more sinister than merry, they were incomparably more grievous than gay. A
      tray of beer glasses was held before him, but he waved it aside.
      &ldquo;Champagne,&rdquo; he muttered. The husky voices commended him; a bare arm crept
      around his neck, soft, stifling; the red silk form was like a blot of
      blood on the gloom; it spread over his arm like a tide of blood welling
      from his torn heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He thought at intervals, when the piano was silent, that he could
      distinguish the sound of low, continuous sobbing; and the futility of
      grief afforded a contemptuous amusement. &ldquo;It's fierce,&rdquo; a shrill voice
      pronounced. &ldquo;They ought to have took her somewhere else; this is a decent
      place.&rdquo; A second hotly silenced this declaration. In the jumble of talk
      which followed he heard the title &ldquo;captain&rdquo; pronounced authoritatively,
      conclusively imposing an abrupt lull. Men entered. With an effort which
      taxed his every resource of concentration he saw that there were two; he
      distinguished two tones&mdash;one deliberate, coldly arrogant, the other
      explosive, iterating noisy assertions. Peering through the film before his
      eyes, Anthony saw that the first, insignificant in stature, exactly and
      fashionably dressed, had a countenance flat and dark, like a Chinaman's;
      the other was a fleshy young man in an electric blue suit, his neck
      swelling in a crimson fold above his collar, who gesticulated with a fat,
      white hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anthony felt the attention of the room centered upon himself, he heard
      disconnected periods; &ldquo;... to the eyes. Good fellow... threw friend out&mdash;one
      of them lawyer jags, too dam' smart.&rdquo; A voice flowed, thick and gummy like
      molasses, from the redness at his side, &ldquo;He's my fellow; ain't you,
      Raymond?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A wave of deathly sickness swept up from the shuddering void and enveloped
      him. He summoned his dissipated faculties, formed his cold lips in
      readiness to pronounce fateful words, when he was diverted by the sharp
      impact of a shutting door, he heard with preternatural clearness a bolt
      slip in its channel. The young man in the blue suit had disappeared. Again
      the sobbing, low and distinct, rose and fell upon his hearing.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general stir in the room; the form beside him rose; and he was
      lunging to his feet when, in the act of moving, he became immovable; he
      stood bent, with his hands extended, listening; he turned his head slowly,
      he turned his dull, straining gaze from side to side. Then he straightened
      up as though he had been opened by a spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&mdash;who called?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Who called me&mdash;Anthony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the short, startled silence which followed the room grew suddenly clear
      before him, the mist dissolved before a garish flood of gaslight that fell
      upon a grotesque circle of women in shapeless, bright apparel; he saw
      haggard, youthful countenances on which streaks of paint burned like
      flames; he saw eyes shining and dead like glass marbles; mouths drawn and
      twisted as though by torture. He saw the fragile, fashionably dressed
      youth with the flat face. No one of them could have called him in the
      clear tone that had swept like a silver stream through the miasma of his
      consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again he heard it. &ldquo;Anthony!&rdquo; Its echo ran from his brain in thrills of
      wonder, of response, to the tips of his fingers. &ldquo;Anthony!&rdquo; Oh, God! he
      knew now, beyond all question, all doubt, that it was the voice of Eliza.
      But Eliza was dead. It was an inexplicable, a cunning and merciless jest,
      at the expense of his love, his longing.... &ldquo;Anthony!&rdquo; it came from above,
      from within.
    </p>
    <p>
      A double, sliding door filled the middle of the wall, and, starting
      forward, he fumbled with its small, brass handles. A sudden, subdued
      commotion of curses, commands, arose behind him; hands dragged at his
      shoulders; an arm as thin and hard as steel wire closed about his throat.
      He broke its strangling hold, brushed the others aside. The door was
      bolted. Yes, it came from beyond; and from within came the sobbing that
      had hovered continuously at the back of his perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook the door viciously; then, disregarding the hands tearing at him
      from the rear, burst it open with his shoulder. He staggered in, looking
      wildly about.... It had, after all, been only a freak of his disordered
      mind, an hallucination of his pain. The room was empty but for the young
      man in electric blue, now with his coat over the back of a chair, and a
      girl with a torn waist, where her thin, white shoulder showed dark,
      regular prints, and a tangle of hair across her immature face.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man in shirt sleeves rose from the couch, on which he had been
      sitting, with a stream of sudden, surprised oaths. The girl who stood
      gazing with distended eyes at Anthony turned and flashed through the
      broken door. &ldquo;Stop her!&rdquo; was urgently cried; &ldquo;the hall door&mdash;&rdquo;
       Anthony heard a chair fall in the room beyond, shrill cries that sank,
      muffled in a further space.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two men faced him in the silent room: the larger, with an empurpled
      visage, bloodshot eyes, shook with enraged concern; the other was as
      motionless as a piece of furniture, in his wooden countenance his gaze
      glittered like a snake's, glittered as icily as the diamond that sparkled
      in his crimson tie folded exactly beneath an immaculate collar. Only, at
      intervals, his fingers twitched like jointed and animated straws.
    </p>
    <p>
      An excited voice cried from the distance: &ldquo;She's gone! Alice's face is
      tore open... out the door like a devil, and up the street in her
      petticoat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man with the flushed face wilted. &ldquo;This is as bad as hell,&rdquo; he
      whimpered. &ldquo;It will come out, sure. You&mdash;&rdquo; he particularized Anthony
      with a corroding epithet. &ldquo;The captain is in it deep... this will do for
      him, we'll all go up&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; the other demanded. He indicated Anthony with his left hand, while
      the other stole into his pocket. &ldquo;He brought her here... you heard the
      girl and broke into the room; there was a fight&mdash;a fight.&rdquo; He drew
      nearer to Anthony by a step.

      their heads. There, again, clear and sweet, his name shaped like a
      bell-note. The familiar scent of a springtide of lilacs swept about him;
      the placid murmur of water slipping between sodded banks, tumbling over a
      fall; the querulous hunting cry of owls hovered in his hearing, singing in
      the undertone of that pronouncement of his name out of the magic region of
      his joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No good,&rdquo; a voice buzzed, indistinct, immaterial. &ldquo;Who'll shut this&mdash;?
      who'll get the girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The girl can't reach us alone....&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An intolerable scarlet hurt stabbed at Anthony out of a pungent, whitish
      cloud. There was a fretful report. A flat, dark face without expression,
      without the blink of an eyelid, a twitch of the mouth, loomed before him
      and then shot up into darkness. The hurt multiplied a thousand fold, it
      poured through him like molten metal, lay in a flashing pool upon his
      heart, filled his brain. He opened his lips for a protest, put out his
      hands appealingly. But he uttered no sound, his arms sank, grew stiff...
      the light faded from his eyes.... imponderable silence. Frigid night....
    </p>
    <p>
      Far off he heard <i>her</i> calling him, imperative, confident, glad. Her
      crystal tones descended into the abyss whose black and eternal walls
      towered above him. He must rise and bear to her that gift like a precious
      and fragile vase which he held unbroken in his hands. An ineffable
      fragrance deepened about him from the massed blooms rosy in the glow where
      she waited, drawing him up to her out of the chaotic wash beyond the
      worlds where the vapors of corrupted matter sank and sank in slow coils,
      falling endlessly, forever.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
